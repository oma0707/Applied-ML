"Subject: california on the brink - - cera alert  cera alert : december 13 , 2000  title : california on the brink  cera knowledge areas : western energy , n . american power , n . american gas  california on the brink  the california stalemate  california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over  credit - worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would  avoid selling to the california market . while numerous factors have  contributed to the high cost of power incurred by california ' s utilities , the  root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation . the current  credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address  the situation . the collective efforts of all market participants should be  focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible .  western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this  summer . perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california  consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis ,  regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and  significant rate increases . the california public utilities commission denied  the requests of pacific gas & electric and southern california edison to end  their rate freezes , forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance  the costs of higher wholesale energy . this has created an unsustainable  accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market .  the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the  galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to  address the underlying structural problems in the industry . however , there is  no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective  solution for customers and the industry as a whole . wholesale and retail  markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain  muddled . in the necessarily political process that will follow , it is  possible that - as has largely been the case so far - the steps taken will fail  to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will  instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws .  in the six months since california ' s supply shortfall began plaguing western  markets , regulators have done little to address the underlying problem .  rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage - establishing a market  environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and  demand side responses - efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for  the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers . indeed ,  several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by  discouraging new power plant additions . these include price caps , repeated  changes to market rules , attempts to seize generator profits , and a  challenging siting and permitting process .  medicine worse than the illness  several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were  accompanied by very few additions to the supply base . regulators did not pay  adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall . the void of consensus  over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of  bandaid remedies that address the symptoms , but not the cause , of  california ' s electric market woes . *  * challenging siting and permitting . despite state action to better  coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants , power  plant developers still face high hurdles . local community opposition alone  has struck down some key proposed facilities .  * price caps discourage investment . state and federal proposals to cap prices  limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market , especially  for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment  to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state .  * repeated rule changes . frequent rule changes in the iso markets ( including  the price caps ) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new  plant development .  * calls for refunds . despite reports by the power exchange , the iso , and the  ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the  california markets , state officials continue to accuse power providers of  gaming the market . calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits  are a threat to new plant development .  * facility inspections . recent inspections of power plants by state officials  to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of  their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust .  cera ' s recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west  are not guaranteed ? to make a profit . prospects of new plant profitability  are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants , decommissioning of  older units , demand growth , and numerous other difficult - to - forecast factors .  california ' s regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of  financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers  considering entering the state .  despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in  the state with a special , limited - term capacity payment , cera estimates that  demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in 2001 .  in addition , the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a  sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the  earliest . therefore , three years remain before a sufficient quantity of  capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk  of an outage .  the road to recovery  there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity  shortfall :  * encourage new build . supply must be part of the answer . this requires a  series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build . while in principal  some have been taken , such as new fast track approval , the success of these  actions can only be measured by the build itself . for now , there is still not  enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness . ?  * stabilize investment climate . utilities must have assurance that they will  ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power . this provides the  credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new  build .  * move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios . one of the reasons the  pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence  ( and even discouragement ) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in  the state - particularly for residential and small commercial customers . with  the market at a peak , however , now is in one sense a sub - optimal time to move  toward term contracting . yet these contracts provide the foundation for a  series of actions - including new supply build and demand side investments . if  they end up above market , they will at least have achieved the desired effect  of knocking down prices , a fact which by itself should provide sufficient  justification for recovering the cost of these commitments .  * encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response . although  originally a feature of california ' s market design , most consumers are  insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates . exposing  customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a  demand response .  * encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "" boom bust "" characteristic of  the market . whether in the form of a capacity payment , a reserve requirement ,  or a minimum term portfolio requirement , the california power market needs to  move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the  market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to  elicit new investment . such a structure can help dampen ( but not eliminate )  future price volatility .  * avoid continuously tinkering with the market . while the market does need to  be restructured as described above , it also needs to be stable and reliable  to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long - term  contractual market for power in california . continually tinkering with the  market structure - such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since  july - only serves to undermine confidence in the market . california needs to  do its best to develop a long - term solution and then let the market run its  course .  * allow for greater environmental flexibility . the state should explore a  more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply  shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to  emissions restrictions .  * free purpa power plants to generate . relief should be granted to purpa  power plants that are operational , but are restricted by contract from  operating to generate only power .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: alliance info alert  dear generation / power marketing executive :  the following is this week ' s alliance express newsletter , and a special  announcement regarding a proposed action by the financial accounting  standards board ( fasb ) .  fasb 133  fasb is considering an exception to statement of financial accounting  standards ( sfas ) no . 133 that will exempt energy companies from the  requirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives . a vote against  the exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility ,  and raises other important concerns for energy suppliers . ( attached is a  summary of this issue . ) the board is expected to vote on this issue during  may 2001 . eei will be taking steps to appraise fasb of our concerns . if  you , or company cfo would like more information about this effort , please  contact richard mcmahon , executive director of the alliance of energy  suppliers , at rmcmahon @ eei . org , or at 202 - 508 - 5571 .  alliance of energy suppliers express   april 25 ,  2001  inside washington  federal affairs  * * * bill repealing puhca is approved by senate committee * * *  the senate banking committee today approved s 206 , a bill that repeals the  public utility holding company act of 1935 . the bill would repeal puhca and  transfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the securities  and exchange commission to the federal energy regulatory commission and  appropriate state agencies .  s . 206 was approved with two amendments . offered by sen . mike enzi ( r - wy ) ,  the first amendment would establish the electric energy market competition  task force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for  electric energy in the united states . the task force would be made up of  representatives of ferc , the department of justice and the federal trade  commission , as well as non - voting representatives from the department of  agriculture and the securities and exchange commission . the amendment also  contained a provision , co - sponsored by sen . paul sarbanes ( d - md ) , that would  preserve ferc ' s authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do  not include the pass - through of holding company costs that are unrelated to  energy .  another amendment , offered by sen . jon corzine ( d - nj ) , initiated a study by  the general accounting office of the success of federal and state governments  in preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies  and in promoting competition and efficient energy markets .  * * * institute   s tax agreement with public power again introduced on hill * * *  the tax agreement eei reached with the american public power association  ( appa ) and the large public power council ( lppc ) again has been introduced in  the house . the bill ( hr 1459 ) contains the same provisions as were in a  measure ( hr 4971 ) , with technical corrections , introduced during the 106 th  congress . hr 1459 was introduced by rep . j . d . hayworth ( r - az ) and nine  original co - sponsors from the ways and means committee .  hr 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes : 1 ) the tax - free  sale or spin - off of transmission assets into an rto is allowed , 2 ) nuclear  decommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing  deductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost - of service ratemaking ,  3 ) the contributions in aid of construction ( ciac ) tax on interconnections to  transmission and distribution facilities is eliminated , and 4 ) private use  tax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution  facilities .  the measure was referred to the house ways and means committee , and eei has  urged congress to act without delay in moving it forward . enactment will  help encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment , the institute  noted . the same legislation has been incorporated into s 389 , senate energy  committee chairman frank murkowski ' s ( r - ak ) energy security bill , and  stand - alone legislation could also be introduced . hearings are expected to  be held in both the senate finance and house ways and means committees ,  probably after consideration of president bush ' s individual tax proposal .  administration / ferc  * * * white house seeks $ 2 trillion budget in fiscal year 2002 * * *  president bush last week transmitted a $ 2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget  request to capitol hill . the administration noted that its proposal  * moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent  in 2002 , * an increase of $ 26 billion over the preceding fiscal year . the  budget bid contains a $ 231 billion total surplus in 2002 , and projects a $ 5 . 6  trillion surplus over the next ten years .  in the energy area , the administration noted the federal government   s  * longstanding and evolving role * in the sector , pointing out that most  federal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts .  it proposed about $ 2 . 8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs ,  and about $ 2 . 1 billion in tax benefits , * mainly to encourage development of  traditional and alternative energy sources . * doe   s budget request was $ 19 . 2  billion , including $ 2 . 3 billion for energy resources programs . this later  figure represents a decrease of $ 196 million , or 7 . 9 percent , from fiscal  year 2001 .  in the environmental sector , the administration sought some $ 7 . 3 billion in  discretionary funding for epa , including a $ 3 . 7 billion operating program  focused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws .  * * * success of restructuring tied to energy strategy , ferc   s massey asserts * * *  electric restructuring may be in jeopardy , and its success * is in the hands  of regulators and policymakers , * ferc commissioner william massey has  asserted . speaking at a recent national governors association policy forum  in philadelphia , commissioner massey urged officials to pay attention to the  key elements of a national energy strategy .  first , he specified , there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy  commodity . turning to a second element , commissioner massey told forum  attendees that * all the supply in the world won   t help unless it can be  delivered over an adequate , efficient , non - discriminatory network . *  commissioner massey identified market structure as the third essential  element of a national energy strategy , while citing an inherent difficulty :  that * good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail  jurisdictions . * accordingly , he said , ferc and the states must work together  on market structure .  the final element of a successful energy strategy , the commissioner  specified , is the need for aggressive ferc intervention when markets fail to  do their job . * if the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator  to ensure reasonable prices for consumers , * he cautioned , they * will surely  think twice before heading down the restructuring path . *  new generation  * * * dynegy to build second plant in kentucky * * *  dynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to  the riverside generating project in lawrence county , kentucky . dynegy will  sell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market . commercial  operation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002 .  * * * ppl to expand generation capacity * * *  ppl corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near  chicago and would increase the capacity of its susquehanna nuclear plant by  100 megawatts . ceo william hecht said the illinois plant is expected to be  in service by the summer of 2002 .  * * * constellation energy group announces eight new plants * * *  constellation energy group this week announced that the company is scheduled  to bring four peaking power plants on line this summer . additionally , four  larger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two  summers . the four peaking plants are located in illinois , pennsylvania ,  virginia and west virginia . the larger power plants are under construction  in california , florida , illinois , and texas .  * we   re building in these seven states because they serve regions where  wholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support  our national power marketing business , * said constellation energy group  chairman and ceo christian poindexter .  * * * california energy commission approves construction of otay mesa generating  plant * * *  pg & e corporation   s national energy group ( neg ) last week announced that the  california energy commission ( cec ) has approved construction of the otay mesa  generating plant in san diego county , which the neg has developed . the 500  megawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1 , 000 homes .  after the development process is completed , calpine corporation will assume  ownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant . neg will  contract for up to half the plants output .  energy data  * * * weekly electric output ( week 15 ) * * *  electric output reached 63 , 528 gwh for the

$ 4 . 20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $ 3 . 46 per barrel greater  that the previous five - year average . for the first quarter of 2001 , cera  anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record  high level of $ 4 . 75 per barrel in the first quarter .  * jet / kerosene differentials versus wti rose $ 0 . 63 per barrel from the  october average , reaching a whopping $ 8 . 59 per barrel in november . in  correspondence with the distillate market , jet / kerosene margins are at  historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight  fundamentals . cera expects jet / kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the  first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the  holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of  $ 5 . 75 per barrel .  * margins for us gulf coast 1 % sulfur residual fuel dropped by $ 2 . 15 per  barrel , reaching $ 3 . 99 per barrel below wti during november . despite the  recent widening of differentials , cera expects soaring natural gas prices to  support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter  months . residual fuel differentials are expected to average $ 2 . 50 per barrel  below wti during the first quarter of next year , at the high end of the  historical range .  us demand highlights  * apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0 . 5 million  barrels per day ( mbd ) from the october level , reaching 8 . 36 mbd for the four  weeks ending december 8 . demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last  year largely because y 2 k concerns helped inflate december demand a year ago .  cera anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder  temperatures arrive , averaging 8 . 08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001 .  * reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3 . 94  mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 , over 7 percent greater than this  time last year . this represents a slight increase of about 0 . 05 million  barrels ( mb ) from the end - october level of 3 . 90 mb , but still a record high  level for early december . with support from low home heating oil inventories ,  particularly in the northeast , distillate demand has been very strong during  the fall of 2000 . cera expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter  months , averaging 3 . 79 mb during the first quarter of next year .  * apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the october level  to reach 1 . 68 mbd for the four weeks ending december 8 . despite the decline ,  apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year - ago level . the  relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel  distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to  help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals . cera expects the  demand for jet fuel to average 1 . 81 mb during the fourth quarter .  * reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0 . 87 mbd for the four weeks  ending december 8 , a decline of about 0 . 09 mbd from the october average and a  slight increase over the november level . demand for residual fuel is  currently 11 percent greater than last year , and surging natural gas prices  are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout  the winter . residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0 . 85 to 0 . 9 mbd  range during the first quarter of 2001 .  us inventory highlights  * primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196 . 5 mb , increasing  almost 10 mb from the end - october value . responding to rising stock levels  and declining apparent demand , forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to  23 . 5 days for the four weeks ending december 8 . forward supply is 2 . 5 percent  below last year ' s level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the  past eight years - although cera still believes coverage is currently  sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter . however , cera is  looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and  production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the  start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year .  * distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of  october at 29 . 2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 .  despite record high apparent demand , strong refinery production levels helped  boost primary distillate inventories slightly , to 115 . 3 mb for this period .  primary stocks are 16 percent below last year ' s level at this time and at  their lowest historical level ever . although stocks are low , cera does not  anticipate shortages to occur this winter . assuming normally cold weather ,  refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting  demand requirements - albeit at a high price .  * jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage , to  reach 25 . 7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december 8 . this  moves jet fuel coverage above the 23 . 5 to 25 days ' supply range that it had  been in for the past four months . the rise of just under 1 day in forward  supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand . jet inventories  and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull  from tight distillate markets strengthen , but supplies are expected to be  adequate for the winter .  * inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply  from october , reaching 41 . 7 days of forward supply during the four weeks  ending december 8 . the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a  drop in demand and an increase in stocks . with demand expected to strengthen  because of colder weather and high gas prices , cera looks for inventories and  coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks .  * * end * *  this cera alert will be available in pdf format within 24 hours .  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

"Subject: industry giants can ' t match this opportunity  another ground breaking news alert from rlyc .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  one company is quickly entering a $ 2 trillion market space with a proposed portfolio of product and service offerings that even the largest multi - national corporations in its industry may have a hard time matching . in just a few months , this company has begun adding and developing innovative new products and targeting acquisitions that could help it reach millions of new long - term customers that could generate tremendous re - occurring revenues for many years to come .  although you have probably never heard of this company , you may soon hear of it even if you don ' t continue reading this message . that ' s because it is making a major push to put its products in the hands of a half million people in the u . s . within the next year .  an upstart company to make a real impact in a two trillion dollar industry  in reality , this company ' s lack of early recognition could be a major plus for you . since the overwhelming majority of investors and institutions don ' t know this company or what they plan to accomplish , their stock is trading at rock bottom prices . but , if they do accomplish even a small part of what they have set out to do over the coming months and years , this company could become a significant player in its trillion dollar industry and its stock reflect its accomplishments .  the company that we ' ll introduce you to today is ( relay capital corp . pink sheets : rlyc ) . rlyc , which recently went public , is a multi - faceted financial services company that focuses primarily on the stored value card market . rlyc ' s present product and service offerings include pre - paid stored - value cards , reward cards , employee payroll cards , gift , retail and affinity group cards , travel cards and funds transfer cards . these services are aimed at a significant market both domestically and internationally .  just because a company is in a large and growing industry doesn ' t necessarily ensure that it will be a winner . in order to be successful , that company also needs to be truly innovative , have very strong partners , be able to reach vast customer bases and have a management team capable of putting it all together and turning its goals into reality . rlyc appears to be that company .  below we ' ll discuss this substantial potential market rlyc is after and what sets rlyc apart from the competition .  the potential stored - value debit card market in the united states alone is approximately 150 million people , of which only about 12 million now maintain active stored - value debit card accounts .  stored - value cards have the potential to help the 50 million adults and their families who have been excluded from the e - commerce revolution because they do not have access to credit or banking facilities . the implications reverberate across industry segments . estimates suggest stored - value transactions could exceed $ 2 trillion in just a few years .  rlyc ' s focus is on providing stored - value cards to the un - banked and under - banked . these terms refer to consumers that that do not have a bank account , debit card . the size of that group is staggering that ' s about one - third of the nation ' s work force !  rlyc capitalizes on the dilemma these consumers face by providing stored - value card programs that make it easy , fast and secure for people and businesses to buy all manners of goods and services using stored - value cards as well as for the un - banked and under - banked to be paid their salaries via the same cards .  but that ' s not all . the benefits relay will offer on its stored value cards as well as other financial services will also be of great benefit to those who already have banking relationships . in this segment , relay plans to offer more services with greater convenience for less cost to the consumer . who wouldn ' t want that ? the payroll market is another enormous market for rlyc  for the under - and un - banked , collecting their pay , cashing payroll checks and then paying bills with those funds can be extremely complicated and time consuming . rlyc ' s stored - value pay transfer card program presents a very effective and innovative solution for this problem .  rlyc ' s pay transfer card program can lower costs to employers to process payroll for the banked and the un - banked alike ! lower costs to cardholders to potentially transfer cash between u . s . cards , cards in foreign countries , and services bought through the cards , improved employee retention , improved customer retention will all be available thanks to rlyc . various programs will make life much easier for cardholders using the system , while also providing the convenience and flexibility of either visa or mastercard purchasing power or 24 hour access to their money through atms .  rlyc signs loi with national staffing company to use its pay transfer cards  earlier this year , rlyc signed a binding letter of intent to provide a pay transfer card program for asgard global resources llc ( click to go to their site ) , a leader in providing technical , craft and administrative staffing services to businesses , industry and government through locations in houston , dallas , long island , orlando , phoenix and southern california all areas with huge un - and under - banked populations .  the potential market for this service is really big . it includes large employers , companies that process payroll and financial institutions that provide banking and payroll services to commercial customers .  this system will simplify payments to widely dispersed employees and contractors while dramatically decreasing payroll distribution by offering a cost effective alternative to printing , cutting , and mailing paper payroll checks . it also helps to reduce a great deal of paper processing of checks and pay , eliminate lost checks , stop payments and minimize fraud . but best of all , this should help to significantly boost rlyc ' s revenues .  $ 150 billion sent worldwide by relatives to home countries  mexicans in u . s . send $ 16 . 3 billion a year back to mexico  with $ 150 billion being transferred internationally each year , remittances are a really big business . in times past , people wanting to send money to relatives back in their home countries had few choices . many times their only choice was an expensive proposition like western union . more recently , more and more people have resorted to purchasing and mailing money orders in order to try to cut down on the cost of sending remittances .  the problems with traditional money transfer methods  with wire services , there are any number of inherent problems when trying to send money to relatives overseas . first , wiring funds across borders can be expensive . this can make it very cost - prohibitive to send smaller amounts of cash and often means that relatives must wait longer to receive their remittances because the sender has to save up until the amount is large enough to warrant the cost associated with the wire service . next there is the problem of logistics . both the sender and the recipient must be able to easily reach a storefront that offers the same wire company ' s services . even if they both are able to do this , the recipient may have to make multiple trips to the wire service office to check to see if their funds have cleared yet and can be released to them . lastly , the sender and the recipient are subjected to varying service fees depending on which wire service they choose . these fees can be very high and can significantly cut into the amount of money the recipient ultimately receives . so , even though using a wire service may be a fairly fast way to transfer money , it can be very expensive and logistically difficult to use .  with money orders there is always the problem of mail service . although in america we have grown accustomed to relatively quick and reliable mail service , this is not always the case in foreign countries . this is especially true in underdeveloped nations , where most remittances are sent . a letter containing a remittance that a family is depending on to provide much needed food and shelter could take many days or even weeks to arrive . and , there is always the chance that it will never arrive at its destination at all , meaning that the sender ' s family could go hungry or end up on the streets .  what is the best way to send remittances ?  by far the most convenient , fast , safe and ultimately cost efficient method to send remittances is through a stored - value card . with this type of service , a person can easily activate a card and then just deposit funds into the account ( onto the card ) via loading station , telephone or the internet for easy use by relatives in his or her home country .  the process is extremely easy and cost - effective . funds can be added to the card ' s account at an ever increasing number of convenient locations . the family member overseas can then draw down on those funds by presenting a card from that account to make purchases or they can use the card to withdraw cash from atms . it could not be any simpler .  rlyc has already begun filling orders  in june of this year , rlyc announced that it had received its first order for 2 , 000 pin - based stored value cards . the company stated that its growth estimates call for approximately 2 , 000 new stored - value cards being put into circulation each month . this could result in exponential revenue growth as new customers are added and its customers take advantage of its other financial services . moreover , though other programs it is working on , it could have one half million cards in the market within the next 18 months .  rlyc plans to expand its services through partner companies and one - stop financial centers  rlyc expects to fuel exponential growth of recurring revenue from individual card usage , monthly fees , as well as other activities occurring at its loading centers or the virtual financial centers it is planning . loading centers are retail locations , such as convenience stores , check cashing facilities or other types of retail facilities serving to dispense or receive cash facilitating transactions for the debit card consumer . rlyc has already established strategic relationships with leading card processors , vendors and distributors , and is in program development with key partners that may bring over 100 , 000 retail locations and a host of great opportunities to dramatically increase its brand recognition .  rlyc plans a host of new financial products and service offerings  some of the products and services rlyc plans to be launching in the coming months include commercial , auto and sba loans , mortgages , all types of affinity group ( loyalty / rewards ) cards , pharmacy discount cards , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health savings accounts and health and life insurance . rylc is expanding extremely rapidly and at this pace , should gain a whole lot of exposure to the investment community f - a - s - t ! ! !  rlyc plans to grow through joint ventures and acquisitions  through a well - planned strategy to partner with major players in the financial services industry and through key acquisitions of complimentary companies , rlyc plans to fuel its growth . it has begun identifying and will negotiate business joint ventures , acquisitions and partnerships within the stored value card industry .  rlyc is positioned to offer expanded payroll products as well as define a niche market for its private label stored value solutions . with corporate network ' s assistance , it expects to add new and expansive products linked to its card platform and provide its customers with a growing range of superior products and increased customer loyalty .  rlyc plans to enter the emerging high growth health savings account ( hsa ) market  rlyc has entered into an agreement in principle with mydaily corp . , an employee benefit and financial services company , to provide health saving account ( hsa ) stored value debit cards that will enable employees to easily pay routine medical bills with pre - tax dollars .  health savings accounts ( hsa ) are tax - sheltered savings accounts similar to an ira , but earmarked for medical expenses and are part of a high deductible insurance plan . deposits are 100 % tax - deductible for the self - employed and for employees of companies that offer an hsa .  this could be an enormous new market for rlyc  it is estimated that all millions of non - elderly americans will soon have access to a health savings account , creating a market of unprecedented potential . in fact , due to the rising costs of employer - sponsored health plans , it is also estimated that one in every two major employers in the united states is considering consumer directed health plans and hsa for their employees .  experienced stored value card and financial services industry executive named ceo of relay capital corp .  e . reese bogle iii , experienced financial services and stored value card industry executive , has been named relay ' s . most recently he was one of the founders , and served as executive vice president and chief operating officer of interstate net bank ( www . isnbank . com ) , establishing it as a visa principal member .  prior to this , mr . bogle , was vp of e * trade bank ' s corporate development and strategic alliances group and president of telebanc insurance services , inc . he also served as vp and marketing director of premium bank , and held a variety of managerial and marketing positions at leading financial services companies .  relay will be adding real depth experience to its management team  the next step is to bring a well qualified management team to relay capital said mr . bogle . once the team is onboard , we intend to build relay capital into a diversified financial services provider that , in addition to looking for exponential growth of recurring revenue generated from individual stored card usage , as well as other financial service activities occurring at our card loading centers or its virtual financial centers , we potentially plan to provide : commercial loans , auto loans , sba loans , mortgages , certificates of deposit ( cd ' s ) , health benefits ( dental , vision ) , life insurance benefits , pharmacy drug discounts , loyalty and reward programs , and shopping discount programs .  with innovative products and services targeted to trillion dollar market ; a host of powerful partners ; key acquisitions in the works ; orders already coming in ; and a top -

"Subject: re : pre - submitted question on espeak  erin ,  a book by martha amram and nalin kulatilaka is an excellent  non - technical introduction to real options and it contains all the most  important  references to more advanced books and papers .  the book has an endorsement by jeff skilling on the cover page .  the research group offered several one - day seminars on real options  and applications to the energy industry . we still have a few binders with  the presentation materials available if you are interested .  we plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall .  the first part of the seminar ( about 4 hours in the morning ) covers general  concept of real options  and their applicability to the energy business .  the second , more technical afternoon session , covers stochastic processes used  to model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific case  studies ( valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas - fired  power plants ) .  the real options approach has been developed specifically to address the  problem of making  investment decisions under uncertainty . nobody in this field claims that this  is a  perfect tool , but it represents a significant progress compared to other  techniques developed  earlier .  discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty through  analysis of several , in most cases , arbitrary scenarios ( most likely ,  optimistic ,  pessimistic ) . these scenarios don ' t identify explicitly the risk drivers  and don ' t specify the future proactive management decisions .  the real , option approach is very powerful because it allows to ( 1 ) capture  uncertainty in an explicit way and ( 2 ) to design investment projects that  allow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to  downside risk .  this approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and  future  operational decisions . forward - looking investment decisions create options  that are exercised  in the future through active management of a project .  the real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to  come  up with the representation of future possible states of the world . the real  challenge is  to use these tools in a sensible way . i have seen in my career ( almost 30  years  of applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems ) many quants  armed with  powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers . the  challenge is not  to run mechanically thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptions  but to translate in a creative way the insights of people who understand  specific businesses  into parsimonious quantitative models . it is especially critical to  stress - test the assumptions  of any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends  critically on any set of assumptions .  if this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying  assumptions .  i remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the  dynamics of oil prices ,  but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very  optimistic upward trend .  one would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question  what economics 101  teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand .  enron north america corp .  from : erin rice @ enron 06 / 27 / 2000 03 : 52 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : pre - submitted question on espeak  good news ! there is already a question waiting for your july 12 espeak  session . i have pasted it below , although you don ' t have to respond until  the actual event . don ' t forget to send a bulleted list of discussion topics  if you would still like us to advertise the event on the elevator screens .  thanks .  - er  submitted by breineck  i was doing some reading about the application of real options in the  evaluation of non - financial assets . would you recommend any texts or articles  for a  more in - depth study of this area ?

"Subject: pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ? we will need a clean market history to calibrate to ,  which we only really have for ratings . we will then need to develop a mapping  from rating / score to price .  getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to  calibrate the model .  building the mechanics of the model , ie , the calibration methodology . neural  nets / fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates , but which exact methods and  software packages to use ?  determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited  information into the model .  getting the "" true "" market price , in order to feed back an error . at present  such a price exists for very few credits .  allocating resources to the development . mckinsey claimed such a system would  take 6 - 10 man - months to develop .  further ideas or comments are requested , as we need to develop our strategy  asap . the model description above is fairly vague , as we don ' t yet have the  knowledge needed to fill in the specific details . further help will be  especially required on this if we are to continue to move at ' internet speed ' .  regards  ben",0,subject pricing credit thousands names challenge next months build automated system provide differential pricing thousands credits 5 000 year end credits illiquid terms market price information making challenge harder end result important terms competitive pricing advantage need overall strategy plan achieve quantitative perspective currently several models credit pricing either use development fmc model default probability approach using bloomberg fair market par yield curves probabilities generated risky libor default bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology fmc model credit spread approach using fmcs directly taking libor credit spread tenor adjusting basis compounding differences bond model fmc approach taking fmcs benchmark curves model regresses input bonds specific name two best fitting benchmarks result zero yield curve shape fmcs level tweaked specific issuer prices generated using spread probability approaches testing bond model spline approach taking bonds specific issuer model fits exponential cubic spline zero coupon price curve builds zero yield curve testing market prices certain liquid names sectors ratings cds market prices used recovery event discount used get bankruptcy swap prices kmv using expected default frequencies edfs kmv model database build model price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments kmv installed model worked next models returns price credit default bankruptcy accuracy price depends many factors liquidity regulatory differences bond cds markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc aim accurately price many liquid names possible based upon models use prices alongside financial information backbone full automated pricing system inputs proposed pricing system specific name model market prices issuers alongside name specific soft data credit reports financial statements credit liquid enough price generated information otherwise credit mapped onto subset liquid credits financial information historical price movements providing mapping weights model price periodically adjusted align market trader prices adjustment feed back weighting mapping composition loose terms could think system price illiquid credit weighted average liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps weightings calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etc key steps implementing system establishing exactly want predict price rating probability score need clean market history calibrate really ratings need develop mapping rating score price getting cleaning historical financial credit data required calibrate model building mechanics model ie calibration methodology neural nets fuzzy logic seem obvious candidates exact methods software packages use determining automated methodology mapping names limited information model getting true market price order feed back error present price exists credits allocating resources development mckinsey claimed system would take 6 10 man months develop ideas comments requested need develop strategy asap model description fairly vague yet knowledge needed fill specific details help especially required continue move internet speed regards ben,4663,857,42

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers .

""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power .  while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . ""  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . ""  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0,subject enron india newsdesk april 27 th newsclips fyi news articles

"Subject: re : storage model : simple issues  brad ,  here are my thoughts on your concerns .  * you needs curve inputs . this is an it job . i can help you for the curves  before the system is properly set up .  * intrinsic value vs time value :  the intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes . if you have a  rough idea about the allocation as  you did in the spreadsheet , we can calucate the intrinsic value within the  model . the difference between the  total and the intrinsic will be the ( option ) time value . however , by  pre - allocating volumes , you killed some options .  in the storage model , volumes are allocated dynamically , therefore it is  hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs . time value .  * factor of loading : factor of loadings are used to give historical  correlation matrix . the three factors correspond to  paralle shift , slopping and curveture . the covariance matrix in the model  is expressed in the form  covar = row ( vol _ { i } ) * ( correl ( i , j ) ) * colum ( vol _ { j } ) where vols are  the implied volatilities from the vol curve .  ( correl ( i , j ) ) = l * l ' + residue ( small )  where l is the factor of loading matrix . so in a simple words , the factor of  loadings ( say , 60 x 3 ) are a simplier way for us to  remember the historical correlation matrix ( say , 60 x 60 ) .  let me know if i can offer further help .  zimin  brad horn 02 / 15 / 2000 07 : 15 am  to : zimin lu / hou / ect @ ect  cc : sandra henderson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : storage model : simple issues  zimin :  thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation . your right to  point out the similarity to market bids . here are some basic questions tied  to implementation and calibration :  model infrastructure / it support : i obviously need to re - build my link to the  forward curves as the model is not working in my new location . short - term  ( aprox 1 month ) , i ' d like to establish a link to the ena database egsprod 32  in order to fetch the long - dated price and volatility curves . my link to ena  forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated  by the new bridgeline entity ( database name and data structure yet to be  defined ) . however , its not clear to me what is required in this two stage  process to support your model . any definition of model input or minimum  support requirements you provide is appreciated . i ' ll then work with sandra  henderson , an enron employee providing our it support , to ensure the model  continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take  place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases .  meanwhile , is there anything you think you can do to ensure im up and running  quickly ?  sandra : linking excel spreadsheets to bridgeline forward curves will be key  to all our pricing projects , not just the storage model supplied by research .  intrinsic vs extrinsic value : it would be helpful to decompose the model ' s  calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic ( time or  option ) value . i could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model  inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value , and then through a simple  difference i could determine the extrinsic value . ive included a simple  spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review . i wanted to  share this with you to ask the following :  does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently  than the simple difference proposed ?  do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the  backcode c - code via . dll in order to ensure run - time is faster ?  my goal here is straightforward : a ) to better understand the model and its  sensitivities . ; and b ) to determine if and when the option approach is  associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of  the time spreads .  factor loadings : what are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with  regards to factor loadings and how i should interpret the graph of the 3  factors calculated ? factor loadings have always been a mystery to me . for  example , what problems should i be looking for as a warning against  mispricing ? what , if anything , is implied about 1 day price change or  expected curve re - shapings ( after all , curve - reshapings are key to storage  valuation ! ! ! ) ?  calibration : we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics  which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs . i ' ll share the  data when we are and model results once im up and running .",0,subject storage model simple issues brad thoughts concerns needs curve inputs job help curves system properly set intrinsic value vs time value intrinsic value depends allocate volumes rough idea allocation spreadsheet calucate intrinsic value within model difference total intrinsic option time value however pre allocating volumes killed options storage model volumes allocated dynamically therefore hard distinguish intrinsic vs time value factor loading factor loadings used give historical correlation matrix three factors correspond paralle shift slopping curveture covariance matrix model expressed form covar row vol correl j colum vol j vols implied volatilities vol curve correl j l l residue small l factor loading matrix simple words factor loadings say 60 x 3 simplier way us remember historical correlation matrix say 60 x 60 let know offer help zimin brad horn 02 15 2000 07 15 zimin lu hou ect ect cc sandra henderson hou ect ect subject storage model simple issues zimin thanks time revised storage valuation right point similarity market bids basic questions tied implementation calibration model infrastructure support obviously need build link forward curves model working new location short term aprox 1 month like establish link ena database egsprod 32 order fetch long dated price volatility curves link ena forward curves would quickly severed favor curves generated new bridgeline entity database name data structure yet defined however clear required two stage process support model definition model input minimum support requirements provide appreciated work sandra henderson enron employee providing support ensure model continues work regardless downstream system changes may take place build establish separate trading systems databases meanwhile anything think ensure im running quickly sandra linking excel spreadsheets bridgeline forward curves key pricing projects storage model supplied research intrinsic vs extrinsic value would helpful decompose model calculated storage price distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic time option value could easily link new spreadsheet tab model inputs calculate intrinsic value simple difference could determine extrinsic value ive included simple spreadsheet calculation intrinsic value review wanted share ask following nature model define intrinsic extrinsic value differently simple difference proposed think would make sense simple value decomposition backcode c code via dll order ensure run time faster goal straightforward better understand model sensitivities b determine option approach associating significant value beyond simple present value time spreads factor loadings thoughts insights offer regards factor loadings interpret graph 3 factors calculated factor loadings always mystery example problems looking warning mispricing anything implied 1 day price change expected curve shapings curve reshapings key storage valuation calibration preparing simple summary descriptive statistics allow refine model inputs share data model results im running,4637,909,43

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me -

speak on  april 20 .  i am going to be out of town on april 27 , so that leaves either next  thursday ( april 6 ) or may 4 . would either of those times work for you ? i ' m  not thinking of any

30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm  to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu '  subject : re : real options course feedback  josh ,  some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one  finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do  plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option  models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded .  i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at  a theoretical level in our last couple of readings .  the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further  discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where  volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of  volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct  risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are  almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some  modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective  probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like  to think about such ideas .  i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester  continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early ,  and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a  naive sort of way .  thanks for the feedback and comments .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am  to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu  cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com  subject : real options course feedback  after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools  presented  thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the  objective  of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety  of  problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded  financial elements .  as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off  areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that  rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust  understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions  that  result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two  issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my  superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of  projects  whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by  financial  instruments . these issues are easy to guess :  1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the  class  has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time  value  questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance  department that can present a firmer position on this question ?  2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures .  if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :  * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,  but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company ?  * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )  there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""  industries .  of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally  screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and  pemex ?  james s . dyer

""  there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of  the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,  will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it  address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just  to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?  the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter  technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are  implementing this technology .  3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas  such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what  value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of  stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to  ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .  the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual  customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful  history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute  averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the  distribution of load looks like .  i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our  concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these  topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be  reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe  in the form of a talk here at enron .  again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again  soon .  stinson  nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm  to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com  subject : stanford project  hello vince and stinson ,  first of all ,  best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !  if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together  some time to have dinner .  i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding  it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is  eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !  we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would  hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into  the "" problem / opportunity generation environment .

( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0,subject combinatorial auction jan 11 mtg background forwarded greg woulfe enron communications 12 28 00 09 58 chonawee supatgiat enron 12 22 00 05 08 pm stinson gibner hou ect ect greg woulfe enron communications enron communications cc subject combinatorial auction stinson greg read paper combinatorial auction multiple winners universal service richard steinberg frank kelly propose combinatorial auction auction multiple items allows bidders realize synergies combinations items combinatorial auction appropriated bandwidth commodity bidders market synergies combination items example want get bandwidth boston dc would bid boston ny ny dc valuable us links one link useless paper propose auctioning method method tested validated yet checked proposition mathematically paper published management science think right look details let know anyhow also combinatorial auctions actually used example alberta government ppa auction enron canada participated 3 4 months ago based long position bandwidth auction exchange might good channel dispose unused unsold bandwidth know much demand market open combinatorial auction exchange might able increase market share taking demand competitors believe moment bandwidth exchanges allow combinatorial bids first one might improve sale channel gain market share note auction one seller many buyers exchange many sellers many buyers moreover think auctioning unsold bandwidth hurt us sell anyway addition dummy bidder system bid auction current wining bid low bid keep product way indirectly put reserve price products let meet sometime first week january chonawee,2547,505,23

"Subject: linux - - hit or miss ?  network world fusion focus : phil hochmuth  on linux  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop ?  03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : will linux be a hit or miss  on the corporate desktop ?  by phil hochmuth  so far this year , the buzz about linux in enterprise networks has  focused on servers and embedded systems , with the growth of linux  severs being most heralded . according to idc , a research firm based in  framingham , mass . , linux was the fastest - growing server operating  system last year , with a 93 % growth rate over the year before . linux  was the second most - shipped operating system in 1999 after windows nt ,  capturing 24 % of new licenses shipped .  as for the embedded market , linux has emerged as an ideal platform for  network appliances , because the system can be modified to handle  specialized , dedicated tasks very well . companies such as cobalt  networks , picazo and progressive systems have announced linux - based  appliances , ranging from web servers to pbxs to firewalls .  but what of the open source hacker  , s dream of  & linux on every desktop ?  8  sure , linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever , with  colorful , shrink - wrapped boxes of caldera , red hat and corel linux now  available at places like compusa . however , analysts have said that  linux  , s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro  areas of network servers and embedded operating systems .  according to idc , linux currently runs on only 4 % of u . s . desktops . the  hold microsoft windows has on the desktop market will remain strong ,  analysts say , despite such factors as microsoft  , s antitrust problems  and the surging popularity of linux .  even some linux executives are skeptical of their product  , s desktop  future . recently , suse ceo roland dyroff downplayed linux  , s future on  desktops . dyroff said ,  & given the lack of applications available , we  really can ' t claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet .  8  a recent survey by survey . com gives more hope for linux desktops .  according to the survey of 1 , 640 enterprise network managers , open  source operating systems are used on 10 % of desktops , with the number  jumping to a surprising 23 % of enterprise desktops by 2002 .  despite the mix of numbers being thrown around , two important factors  that will determine the success of linux as an enterprise client  desktop are : a standardized , easy - to - use graphical user interface ( gui )  and available applications .  one company that is working to make linux more user friendly is palo  alto - based eazel , which is designing a next - generation file management  system and user interface to run on top of the linux kernel . according  to eazel  , s web site , the company  , s goal is to bring linux to the masses  and  & do it in a way that appeals to today ' s linux users and to mere  mortals .  8  the company was founded by a group of former apple executives , and is  allied with the gnome project , which has been doing extensive linux  desktop environment development for several years . eazel is due to have  a product out by the middle of this year . with an intuitive , icon - based  file management environment , eazel is hoping its user interface will be  an improvement over the two current linux guis , gnome and kde , and will  help standardized the look and feel of linux for  & regular  8 users . for  enterprise mangers who have already embraced linux on the server side ,  this development will be worth keeping an eye on .  on the applications side , several office productivity suites have been  available for some time , such as sun  , s staroffice suite and koffice for  the kde desktop . corel has also ported its office products , such as  wordperfect , over to linux to complement its own distribution of the  operating system . while there have been recent rumors ( started by linux  care vice president arthur tyde ) that microsoft is working on a port of  ms office to linux , microsoft officials deny this .  while linux may never supplant windows as the industry - standard desktop ,  there should be plenty of opportunity for linux pcs in enterprise nets  in the future .  to contact phil hochmuth :  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  phil hochmuth is a writer and researcher for network world , and a former  systems integrator . you can reach him at mailto : phochmut @ nww . com .  for related links - - click here for network world ' s home page :  http : / / www . nwfusion . com  staroffice software from sun  http : / / www . sun . com / staroffice  corel linux os  http : / / www . corel . com / freedom / freedom . htm  eazel  http : / / www . eazel . com  gnome - - the gnu network object model environment  http : / / www . gnome . org  koffice - - the integrated office suite for kde , the k desktop  environment  http : / / koffice . kde . org /  cobalt networks , inc .  http : / / www . cobaltnetworks . com  progressive systems  http : / / www . progressive - systems . com  picazo  http : / / www . picazo . com  other linux - related articles from network world :  active directory upgrade requires strong game plan , network world ,  03 / 13 / 00  subscription services  to subscribe or unsubscribe to any network world e - mail newsletters ,  go to :  to change your email address , go to :  subscription questions ?

ask prices  i think we should let the price float with the market instead of trying to  forecast it . otherwise , if our forecast is not consistence with the market ,  we may have an imbalance in the bid - ask orders and we may end up taking some  positions . you know , as russ and martin pointed out , we cannot fight with the  studio and exhibitors because they have inside information and can game the  price easily .  one way to ensure the balance of the bid - ask orders is to embed an exchange  system inside our bid - ask prices front end . each week , we have a trading  period . during the period , instead of posting bid - ask prices , we post  "" tentative "" bid - ask prices , then we ask our customers to submit their  acceptable buying or selling price . these "" tentative "" bid - ask prices get  updated and are shown to the public . of course , customers can revise / withdraw  their bids anytime during the trading period . at the end of the period , we  calculate and post the final bid and ask prices . the seller who submits lower  selling price than our final bid price gets paid at the bid price . the buyer  who submits higher buying price than our final ask price pays at the ask  price . next week , we repeat the same process .  this way , we can manage our positions easily and we can also behave like a  broker where we don ' t take any position at all . we make profit from those  bid - ask spread . we don ' t have to worry about forecasting accuracy and  insiders ' trading because we don ' t have to take any position . let the market  be the one who decides the price .  if we maintain our net position as zero , at the end , when all the actual  gross box office numbers are reported in those publications , our customers  with open long / short positions are perfectly matched . using the  mark -

"Subject: revised : organizational changes  to : enron north america corp .  from : cliff baxter and kevin hannon  in july , as part of the enron north america ( ena ) reorganization , the  implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the  continued growth of ena including : 1 ) accelerate the development of our  people , 2 ) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets ,  and 3 ) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups , both  within ena and across enron . consistent with these objectives and with the  corporate goal of fostering   b ) the downstream coverage / origination groups which focus on delivering a  broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers  including pulp and paper , chemicals , plastics , refined products , metals and  mining , heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation ,  textiles and glass manufacturing the eastern and western u . s . midstream  coverage / origination groups which focus on energy , finance and industries .  downstream coverage / origination  as energy deregulation continues in north america , it is becoming clear that  the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both  ena and enron corp . further , it is clear that ena can significantly expand  its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial  solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of enron  corp . against this backdrop , the downstream coverage / origination function  will expand its product offering to include not only ena  , s existing energy  commodities , energy services , finance , assets and pulp and paper capabilities  but also ees  , s energy outsourcing capability and global fuel  , s chemicals ,  plastics and refined products risk management capability . these additional  capabilities will be offered in conjunction with ees and the global fuels  groups . given the size and importance of this enron initiative , greg piper  will be returning from portland to manage this business . under greg  , s  leadership , the downstream origination effort will be segmented into three  sub - groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering :  a ) pulp and paper  ) edward ondarza will continue to manage the coverage  activities in the pulp and paper business . this group will be responsible for  the provision of innovative  products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provision  of paper risk management products ;  b ) chemicals , plastics and refined products  ) we have asked jim ajello to  lead the coverage activities in this business . this group will be  responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the  chemicals and refined products industries ;  c ) non - integrated industrials  ) bruce garner , formerly leader of bankers  trust  , s global metals and mining group in london , has joined ena to lead the  coverage activities in this business . this group will be responsible for the  provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining ,  heavy manufacturing , industrial gases , fertilizers , transportation , textiles  and glass manufacturing industries .  midstream coverage / origination  a ) eastern coverage / origination  ) this group  , activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the eastern  interconnect . we have asked janet dietrich to assume the leadership of this  group ;  b ) western coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  energy , finance and power development solutions for electric and gas  utilities , municipals , co - ops and energy service companies in the wscc . they  will also continue to manage all qualified facilities ( qf ) restructuring  opportunities in the western u . s . we have asked chris calger to assume the  leadership of this coverage group . chris will relocate to portland from  calgary where he currently leads the canadian downstream origination efforts ;  c ) ipp merchant coverage / origination  ) this group  , s activities will focus on  the provision of structured energy , finance and asset solutions for the  emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio  , s of merchant  power generation either through development or acquisition . we have asked  mike miller to assume the leadership of this group . in addition , mike will  continue to manage the power development activities in the eastern  interconnect ;  d ) eastern qf restructuring  ) this group will focus on the qf restructuring  opportunities in the eastern interconnect including the existing  restructuring and re - capitalization of the east coast power assets . we have  asked dave duran to assume the leadership of this business . greg blair ,  formerly of enron asia  , s development group , doug clifford , formerly of  citizens power , and dick lydecker , formerly of cogen technology , will join  this newly formed business .  2 ) commercial transactions :  the commercial transactions group ( ctg ) , co - headed by ray bowen and jeff  donahue , was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of  transactions within ena  ) and thereby , improve ena  , s efficiency in executing  transactions and free - up the origination groups to increase their intensity  of client coverage . ctg consists of six primary functions : transaction  development , capital structuring and portfolio management , commodity  structuring and transportation , transactional support / accounting , technical  analysis and upstream asset management .  the transaction development group will be responsible for deal leadership ,  execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction  with the originator . the function will be divided into four teams , each of  which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups . this  dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link , better service  and greater accountability with the origination groups ; however , the ctg  resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to  the highest value transactions across the coverage functions :  a ) midstream transaction development will be dedicated to the eastern and  western coverage / origination groups . the senior members of this group  include billy lemmons , george mccormick , erin norris and russ porter . billy  lemmons joined enron in 1992 . most recently , he was the vice - president of  capital structuring and risk management for ees . russ porter joins us today  from dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power  origination .  b ) downstream transaction development will be dedicated to ena  , s industrial  origination efforts in pulp and paper , petrochemicals and refining ,  environmental energy , metals and mining and other industries as coverage is  established . the senior members of this team include rodney malcolm , jay  boudreaux , finley biggerstaff and chris helfrich . we anticipate announcing  two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks .  c ) generation transaction development will be dedicated to the ipp merchant  services and power plant development and qf restructuring groups . the senior  members of this team include thomas suffield , andy kelemen , kelly mahmoud and  john house . thomas suffield joined enron in 1996 . most recently , he was the  vice - president of origination for the latin american group in azurix . we  anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few  weeks .  d ) upstream transaction development will be dedicated to the producer  finance , coal and gas assets groups . the senior members of this team include  brad dunn , john curtin and chris hilgert . we hope to announce the addition  of at least one vp to this group prior to yearend .  ray bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the upstream and  downstream transaction development teams with jeff donahue having primary  responsibilities for the midstream and generation teams . andrea reed will  continue to head capital structuring and portfolio management : all junior  commercial resources within the transaction development teams will have dual  responsibilities to both their transaction development teams and to the  capital structuring group . the remaining four groups within ctg will remain  largely unchanged . in addition , the origination and the transaction  development teams and their respective origination groups will be located  together .  we believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage  and industry knowledge in all ena  , s markets particularly in the industrial  markets . it will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between  the coverage / origination groups and the ctg groups .  please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in north  america by working with us to implement these changes .",0,subject revised organizational changes enron north america corp cliff baxter kevin hannon july part enron north america ena reorganization

 i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has  cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .  i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is  there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was  wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some  sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my  request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the  book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corporation , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity  markets . this chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail  the methods , merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process  assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . examples  from crude , gas , and electricity markets are used to illustrate the  technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0,subject energy book vl 0 vince rewritten paragragh chapter 3 please read return comments thanks grant forwarded grant masson hou ect 02 16 2000 02 48 pm chris strickland 02 15 2000 05 28 42 grant masson ect vkamins ect cc subject energy book hi grant hope well trust got message via voicemail ileft vince late friday afternoon inability travel trying rearrange trip couple week time ear cleared look forward meeting one day wrote vince last week asking favour sure ifhe houston know guys probably busy wondering write sentences sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter 1 overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written although think changed slightly version see style many thanks best regards chris 2 overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter 2 analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter 3 written vince kaminski grant masson ronnie chahal enron corporation discusses volatility estimation energy commodity markets chapter builds previous one examines detail methods merits pitfalls volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced chapter 2 examples crude gas electricity markets used illustrate technical interpretative aspects calculating volatility chapter 4 examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter 5 presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter 6 investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter 7 shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter 6 simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter 8 develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter 9 focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters 5 7 general model chapter 7 ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter 10 looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables,6014,1118,47
