"Subject: come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! !  * * * please read this email to the end * * *  try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing  is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports .  there is my true story .  i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the  system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) ,  there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just  wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going  very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went  into this thing !  thank ' s to the computer age and the internet !  be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !  before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing  about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national  weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated  whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the  participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are  bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .  = = print this now for your future reference = =  if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably ,  please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this program :  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your  life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in  the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as  it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and  address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the  people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on  every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to  become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

my phone number is ( 617 ) 492 - 9551 .  i graduated from princeton university in 1996 ( mathematics ) , and came  straight to mit for a  ph . d . in operations management at the sloan schoolof management . in my first  three years i took all the required coursework in mathematics ,  optimization , stochastic processes , etc . , as well as a number of courses in  psychology ( at mit and harvard ) . i am working with prof . gabriel bitran ,  and i am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations . in  particular , i am interested in the interaction between customers and  companies ( hence the interest in psychology ) . the ( tentative ) title of my  phd thesis is "" pricing substitute products on the internet "" , and i am  sending you the summary which i sent to tom gros a few weeks ago that will  give you an idea of what this research is about .  thanks again , and i ' m looking forward to meeting you and your research  group next week .  paulo  pricing substitute products on the internet  objective :  to develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold  on  the internet .  motivation :  this research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and  optimization  models are not appropriate for internet - related businesses . the technological  innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of  information  which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices .  furthermore ,  companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can  have access to .  the problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue  faced  by internet companies . consumers usually search for generic products ( e . g .  vcrs  or computers ) without knowing exactly what they will buy . companies can show  different products and different prices to each consumer . this type of  flexibility  was not available until the internet came about .  the problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet . the  methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of  other settings , such as pricing services . services are unique , and there are  many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a  given company . our model will help companies decide which services to offer  to which customers and how much to charge for these services .  research strategy :  our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components  which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies . these  components are choice models and optimization models .  choice models :  choice models describe how customers make choices . the management literature  draws on two main sources for these models : psychology and economics . the  common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic  elimination methods . these methods consist of the elimination of options  based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice  remains .  these methods tend to be very context - specific and do not lend themselves very  easily to mathematical analysis . economists focus on utility - maximing models  that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological  models .  the most common economic model of choice is the logit model . the problem with  these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how  consumer make choices on the internet . the first step in our research will  be  to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between  customers  and companies on the internet .  optimization :  traditionally , the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a  certain planning horizon . on the internet , the problem of maximizing revenue  still exists , but there is also a need to learn about customers . short term  profit is based on sales , but long term profit is based on how well you know  your customers and are able to retain them . the optimization problem must  therefore include a short term component ( sales ) and a long term component  ( learning ) .",0,subject summer

"Subject: energy book  hi grant ,  hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail  that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -  i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has  cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .  i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is  there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was  wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some  sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my  request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the  book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0,subject energy book hi grant hope well trust got message via voicemail ileft vince late friday afternoon inability travel trying rearrange trip couple week time ear cleared look forward meeting one day wrote vince last week asking favour sure ifhe houston know guys probably busy wondering write sentences sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter 1 overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written although think changed slightly version see style many thanks best regards chris 2 overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter 2 analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter 3 written vince kaminski grant masson enron capital trade chapter 4 examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter 5 presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter 6 investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter 7 shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter 6 simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter 8 develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter 9 focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters 5 7 general model chapter 7 ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter 10 looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables

"Subject: full circle : asps the new big blue ?  network world fusion focus : mike jude and nancy meachim  on application service providers  today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new big blue ?  03 / 15 / 00  dear wincenty kaminski ,  today ' s focus : full circle : asps the new  big blue ?  by mike jude and nancy meachim  the terms  & asp  8 and  & ibm  8 may have more in common than being three -  letter acronyms .  remember big blue of the early  + 60 s ? the vision , then , was centralized  computing . mainframe computers hosted complex , expensive applications  that end users accessed via dumb terminals . it infrastructure ,  especially memory , was expensive and needed to be controlled . with  computing resources centralized , ibm reasoned , they were easier to  maintain .  of course , ibm got it wrong , in that computers became a cheap commodity .  and users weren  , t happy simply using dumb terminals . they wanted a  bigger share in all that technology offered . so , as memory prices fell ,  so did the idea of central control . dumb terminals were transformed into  intelligent desktop machines that could store applications and data . the  glass house populated by white - smocked technicians went out of fashion .  looking back on those times , many of us would shake our heads and wonder  how ibm could have been so wrong . but maybe big blue wasn  , t so far off .  thanks to the advent of application service providers , centralized  computing is making a comeback . asps offer centralized application  management .  the market started as a way to offer the benefits of server  advertisement protocol and other complex enterprise resource planning  software to small companies or companies with less technical savvy . but  asps now host all kinds of applications , including small , multilicensed  programs whose images are downloaded to end users on demand . but , the  principle remains the same : central control makes support much more  efficient and usually cheaper . how about that , ibm ?  to be fair , the dynamics of an asp are very different from old  centralized mainframe operations . an asp doesn  , t just host and support  an application for general distribution over an in - house proprietary  network . unlike the ibm vision , an asp is very dependent on network  service . it is also very sensitive to service levels . in the  + 60 s , if  the mainframe let you down , you ended up twiddling your thumbs for an  hour or so , and your only recourse was that white - smocked fellow .  nowadays , users start to scream if service is interrupted for even a  minute . and woe to the asp who brings down a customer operation . the  world of the asp is much more complex than that of the old  + 60 s shop .  however , if one could magically transport a computer user from the  + 60 s  to the wonderful new 2000 s , would it seem all that different to him ? in  an ideal asp world , a la scott mcnealy  , s vision , users would sit down  at a semidumb terminal , download the application du jour , and start  working . what did the  + 60 s user do ? kind of the same thing !  so you are probably wondering , what is the point ?

"Subject: non - firm power curve building  hi vince ,  amitava and i have received a request to build a non - firm power curve for each region from david hoog ' s double trigger folks . the objective , as they explain it , is to allow the desk to buy non - firm from the market , buy david ' s outage product , and sell firm to the market . accountants would like a curve to mark the non - firm position .  my initial thought is that the desk should provide this non - firm curve , but it seems that this market is very illiquid and they are reluctant so they have put the ball in david hoog ' s court to build the curve if david wants to sell his product internally to the desk .  assuming we build the curve , the next issue is how to define "" non - firm "" ? the only way i can think of is to tie the non - firmness to a specific generation unit or group of units . this will allow the purchase of david ' s outage product to cover the non - firmness risk . tying the definition of non - firmness to a whole region seems implausible - - - what does it mean to give a marketer the option to not deliver power if there is any problem anywhere in the region ? consequently , the non - firm curve takes on a unit - level interpretation , and not a region - level interpretation . consequently , i do not see how we can talk about the "" non - firm curve for the region "" ? we will need to build a non - firm curve for each generation unit or group of units .  maybe i could get your thoughts later today .  thanks ,  vasant",0,subject non firm power curve building hi vince amitava received request build non firm power curve region david hoog double trigger folks objective explain allow desk buy non firm market buy david outage product sell firm market accountants would like curve mark non firm position initial thought desk provide non firm curve seems market illiquid reluctant put ball david hoog court build curve david wants sell product internally desk assuming build curve next issue define non firm way think tie non firmness specific generation unit group units allow purchase david outage product cover non firmness risk tying definition non firmness whole region seems implausible mean give marketer option deliver power problem anywhere region consequently non firm curve takes unit level interpretation region level interpretation consequently see talk non firm curve region need build non firm curve generation unit group units maybe could get thoughts later today thanks vasant
"Subject: introduction  vince :  as way of introduction , i wanted to write a bit about mars inc . and then  about cds ,  the unit i head . mars is a private company , considered to be the largest  privately owned  manufacturing company in the world . mars is not in the habit of disclosing  its  finances ,  so the best i could do is refer to forbes ' estimate of $ 15 billion annual  revenue and  to the profit margins of similar companies between 5 - 12 % . mars is in the  business of  manufacturing confectionery ( m & m , dove bar , skittles , twix , - all ( r ) )  food ( uncle ben rice ( r ) ) pet food ( pedigree , whiskas waltham ( r ) ) and other  products .  mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that  emphasizes the  long term goals of the company . part of the philosophy is to look for win - win  solutions with  its suppliers , customers and partners .  as can be understood from the nature of the company , a large chunk of its  expenses  goes towards purchasing commodity like products , and hence the history of  researching  those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand  ( people  eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer ) .  cds has a history of few decades in forecasting weather and has been very  successful ,  with an envious track record , in helping mars get a competitive advantage in  these arenas .  cds is a global group ( in 4 countries across two continents ) which supports  the  purchasing  function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas . it is a  multidiscipline and  multinational team with a lot to offer .  not having a ready access to the energy markets , and with a risk profile based  on  manufacturing expertise , mars has decided to look for potential partners in  this  area .  enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to  talk to .  in talking to enron , we are careful to suggest that mars is not committing to  anything  at this point , and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to  pursue the opportunity  we discussed in the future .  i am looking forward to our video conference call .  kind regards ,  avi  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  avi i . hauser phd mba  cds director  100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 - 1383  + 1 973 691 3664 ( office )  + 1 973 347 8189 ( fax )  + 1 973 727 3622 ( car + slow paging )  hauser @ cdsusa . com",0,subject introduction vince way introduction wanted write bit mars inc cds unit head mars private company considered largest privately owned manufacturing company world mars habit disclosing finances best could refer forbes estimate 15 billion annual revenue profit margins similar companies 5 12 mars business manufacturing confectionery dove bar skittles twix r food uncle ben rice r pet food pedigree whiskas waltham r products mars prospered years unique philosophy emphasizes long term goals company part philosophy look win win solutions suppliers customers partners understood nature company large chunk expenses goes towards purchasing commodity like products hence history researching commodities weather influences supply demand people eat less ice cream winter less chocolate summer cds history decades forecasting weather successful envious track record helping mars get competitive advantage arenas cds global group 4 countries across two continents supports purchasing function corporate large arenas multidiscipline multinational team lot offer ready access energy markets risk profile based manufacturing expertise mars decided look potential partners area enron presence market place certainly makes interesting party talk talking enron careful suggest mars committing anything point find interest pursue opportunity discussed future looking forward video conference call kind regards avi avi hauser phd mba cds director 100 international drive mt olive nj 07828 1383 1 973 691 3664 office 1 973 347 8189 fax 1 973 727 3622 car slow paging hauser cdsusa com

trip time from the client to the server  > ( irrespective of how far away the client is from your measurement  > host ) , because of tcps three - way handshake for connection  > establishment ; when you see the opening syn , you wait for the client  > to ack the server ' s syn ack and you have the client - > server round - trip  > time . i think you ' ve actually already done some of this ? we could  > also potentially try to correlate dns queries and tcp connections ,  > perhaps determining some probabilities in a given environment of a  > host initiating a tcp connection to a host for which it just received  > an a record , and track various application - level response times ( i ' d  > personally love to have a lot of data on the ratio of dns response  > time to tcp transfer time for http connections ) . even if the  > measurement makes no attempt to discern what constitutes a web  > transaction to the user ( a full page , usually many tcp connections ) .  >  > anyway , i think there are some fairly interesting things we can  > measure with simple techniques , these are just some simple ones .  > there may be some interesting things we could do by digging into  > payloads of a few of the other highly - utilized applications , but doing  > it for tcp is a nightmare perfomance - wise . but we now have the basic  > infrastructure to do things with dns over udp . we can probably cover  > any open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties that  > would make it completely unusable . snmp , for example . . . while its  > application is limited , network service providers would find  > round - trip time information for snmp packets from their network  > management stations to agents very useful . i think there are some  > rudimentary things we can do with tcp as well , and i also think some  > sites would be interested in having some rudimentary information . for  > example , a weighted ( by traffic ) round - trip time distribution for tcp  > traffic to / from all networks with which you communicated ( say at / 24  > granularity ) . this gives sites a notion of how close they are to  > those they talk to most frequently . with a little more work , we could  > probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates for every end network for  > which we see tcp data ( we could certainly get a reasonable number for  > the maximum observed bandwidth ) .  >  > these methods also decouple the measurement from the traffic . while we  > all know the value of that , i think it ' s significant in that active  > probers can be run on the same host , decoupled from the actual  > measurement , and with timestamps coming from kernel space ( bpf ) . i ' ve  > been thinking about this for a long time , because eventually i ' d like  > skitter ( and other tools ) to be able to do use tcp packets for probing ,  > with no need for things like ip firewall code ; if i can just properly  > time non -

older material comes personal emails posting give us ideas think able attend wg meeting san jose thursday 2 mar like spend time morning getting know attendees interests experience making internet measurements suggest good way would group give short 10 minutes response times gets even interesting need able see traffic one direction client server get fairly accurate round trip time client server irrespective far away client measurement host tcps three way handshake connection establishment see opening syn wait client ack server syn ack client server round trip time think actually already done could also potentially try correlate dns queries tcp connections perhaps determining probabilities given environment host initiating tcp connection host received record track various application level response times personally love lot data ratio dns response time tcp transfer time http connections even measurement makes attempt discern constitutes web transaction user full page usually many tcp connections anyway think fairly interesting things measure simple techniques simple ones may interesting things could digging payloads highly utilized applications tcp nightmare perfomance wise basic infrastructure things dns udp probably cover open udp protocol without incurring performance penalties would make completely unusable snmp example application limited network service providers would find round trip time information snmp packets network management stations agents useful think rudimentary things tcp well also think sites would interested rudimentary information example weighted traffic round trip time distribution tcp traffic networks communicated say 24 granularity gives sites notion close talk frequently little work could probably make reasonable bandwidth estimates every end network see tcp data could certainly get reasonable number maximum observed bandwidth methods also decouple measurement traffic know value think significant active probers run host decoupled actual measurement timestamps coming kernel space bpf thinking long time eventually like skitter tools able use tcp packets probing need things like ip firewall code properly time non blocking connects count passive tool see syn syn ack use tcp port round trip time measurements trick kernel sending tcp packets raw socket need feedback passive tool tracing like skitter needs know reply seen hop destination reached difficult simple bytestream oriented ipc sufficient going like idea proposed others maybe funded point tracking instrumenting freenix tcp ip stacks lot useful information could

'  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  dpc board empowers md to cancel mseb contract  the enron power project crisis on thursday deepened with the board of dabhol power company authorising the management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board even while international lenders to the project asked enron to renegotiate power purchase agreement signed with the mseb .  the decision to authorise managing director neil mcgregor to issue "" notice of termination on the contract to sell 740 mw of power "" was taken after the board prevented mseb from voting on the ground that it was an interested party . the decision was taken with six votes in favour and the single opposition vote was cast by idbi , sources said .  according to reports , financial institutions such as anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , citibank , abn - amro and the state bank of india have on wednesday advised enron against terminating its ppa with mseb . mseb chairman vinay bansal , who with two other directors attended the meeting on wednesday representing maharashtra ' s 15 per cent stake in the near $ 3 - billion project , said : "" the indian side told them that it would be unfortunate if enron broke the contract . "" while bansal declined comment on the board decision , the sources said the indian side had expressed its interest to holds talks on the issue rather than terminating the project and there were possibilities of a fresh power purchase agreement between the company and the state . ( pti )  the economic times , friday apr 27 2001  mseb pays rs 134 cr under ' protest ' to dpc  despite the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of rs 134 crore disputed amount , towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dabhol . "" we were ready with the payment on wednesday itself , but dpc officials could not collect the cheque due to the statewide bandh "" , a senior mseb official said . "" we have disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore and it would be now taken up at the disputes resolution forum , of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members "" , mseb sources said .  last week , dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb that it would not accept "" protest payments "" anymore . cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums , which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the "" purported protest or reservation "" . mseb had paid a rs 113 . 5 crore february bill in protest last month . on april 23 last , both domestic and international lenders of dpc had met in london and held exhaustive discussions the multinational ' s move to issue a termination notice to mseb and state government . ( pti )  business standard , friday , april 27 , 001  enron india md authorised to terminate ppa  the board of the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) , at its meeting in london on wednesday , authorised the managing director of enron india to issue a notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government . "" the board has authorised wade cline to serve the termination notice . however , this does not mean that the termination notice will be served immediately . it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises , "" a state government source told business standard from london . he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders .  the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue . the hardening of the board ' s stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpc ' s lenders , who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice . the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage . serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders , who have an exposure of about $ 2 billion in the project . sources said given the lenders ' strong opposition to termination of the contract , the enron board ' s "" enabling resolution "" did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio . the maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice . the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract .  enron holds 65 per cent in dpc , while us - based ge and bechtel hold 10 per cent each . the balance 15 per cent is held by mseb through a special purpose vehicle , maharashtra power development corporation . the mseb representatives were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party . the idbi representative protested against the board ' s decision . the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal . the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills .  after mseb failed to pay rs 102 crore towards the december 2000 bill , dpc invoked the state government ' s guarantee and then the union government ' s counter guarantee . when payment of the rs 127 - crore january bill became overdue , dpc again invoked the state government ' s guarantee . mseb retaliated on january 28 , 2001 by slapping a rs 401 - crore penalty for non - supply of electricity at adequate levels . it demanded that dpc adjust the bills against this penalty . "" this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting "" , a state government official said . the centre also supported mseb ' s stand and refused to honour the counter guarantee . the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause . a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on .  the financial express , friday , april 27 , 2001  foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc , sanjay jog & raghu mohan  global banks comfortable with enron pull - out  lenders to the dabhol power company ( dpc ) are a sharply divided lot . international lenders , in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india ( idbi ) , are categorical that additional assistance to dpc ' s phase - ii will be held in abeyance despite the completion of 92 per cent of the project work . the stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) within the next four weeks . this follows the authorisation given to enron india ' s managing director k wade cline and dpc president & ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice , and transfer notices to mseb , following wednesday ' s dpc board meeting in london .  the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is : emotions do not work . contractual obligations and payments have to be met . we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations . there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of it . the structuring of dpc ' s debt has created two classes of lenders . in phase - i , international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phase - ii , no lender is . however , all lenders have a parri passu charge , making attachment of assets a messy affair .  sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders to phase - ii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security - other than assets - like a sovereign cover . "" it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to 16 . 5 per cent from 21 . 5 per cent , "" a leading foreign banker pointed out . three points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were : a ) there are contractual obligations b ) mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c ) mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs 401 crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power .  while local lenders led by idbi - with mseb parroting the same - were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one , international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out . this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for termination given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for . international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present form . the points of contention are : a ) that phase - i of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b ) phase - ii is not and c ) to the extent that phase - ii is covered by assets , cancellation of phase - ii may see all assets - even those under phase - i - getting attached . therefore , an examination on the segregation of assets under phase - i and phase - ii is now warranted .  pti adds : in a significant move , dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of about rs 2840 crore on the centre . a decision to authorise dpc president neil mcgregor to issue a termination notice to mseb for sale of power was taken by the board at its meeting on wednesday .  the indian express , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron : dabhol chief gets powers to end deal with the mseb  the board of dabhol power company , a subsidiary of houston - based enron corp , has decided to warn the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) that it intends to pull the plug on its guhagar - based project . in a board meeting held in london on wednesday , the board decided to authorise dpc president and ceo neil mcgregor and enron india ' s managing director k wade cline to serve a ' ' preliminary ' ' termination notice for sale of power to the mseb within the next four weeks . the dabhol project has been mired in disputes since mseb began missing payments last year . mseb owes dabhol power $ 48 million for power delivered in december and january . the payment ran into a dispute after mseb slapped penalty notices of rs 401 crore on dpc for its failure to supply power within three hours of the demand being placed . but mseb has paid $ 24 million for february . and a payment of $ 31 million was made for march on thursday .  the $ 3 billion dabhol project is the largest foreign investment made in india to date . issuing the preliminary termination notice could enable dabhol to suspend deliveries as it negotiates payment disputes . while a preliminary termination notice is the first of three steps that could potentially lead to the abandonment of the project by enron , analysts have described the decision as a ' ' procedural ' ' move consistent with dpc ' s negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb .  after the company issues the preliminary termination notice , step two would be an official termination notice , and step three would be a notice that the company is surrendering control of the project . if the project is terminated , the government of india will have to take a hit of $ 300 million besides paying bills of rs 1 , 500 crore for the next one year to enron as penalty . ' ' our ( centre ' s ) liability , if dabhol power project is terminated , would be one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million , ' ' power secretary a k basu said . ' ' contractually , the centre will have to pay one year ' s electricity bill , totalling at present prices about rs 1 , 400 - 1 , 500 crore , and take over dpc ' s debt , which stands at around $ 300 million , if the project was terminated , ' ' basu said in delhi . dabhol power is in the process of completing the second phase of the 2 , 184 - megawatt power - plant project , which is 95 per cent through .  while the international lenders to the project are pressurising the company to get out of the project , indian lenders , led by idbi , are asking the company to reconsider its decision on its termination notice . during the meeting in london , mseb which holds a 15 per cent stake in the project , had strongly opposed dpc ' s move to authorise cline and mcgregor to issue notices for termination .  mseb chairman vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar - both directors on the dpc board - and the state principal secretary ( energy ) vm lal , an invitee to the board , raised the issue at the board meeting in london . mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly ' ' threatening ' ' to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolation . in recent weeks , dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with the mseb , delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra - a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war , coup , or a similar radical political event . in this case , dpc ' s move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricity . dpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power . critics object to the company charging rs 7 . 1 a kilowatt - hour for its power , compared with around rs 1 . 5 a kilowatt - hour charged by other suppliers .  the hindu , friday , april 27 , 2001  offer of renegotiation ' too late ' : enron , by mahesh vijapurkar  mumbai , april 26 . the enron - sponsored dabhol power company , which last night authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board , has decided to keep a stiff upper lip . this , in turn , has stoked speculation that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent , while in reality , a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa .  as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu , ` ` it is not sudden death of the project ' ' and in all probability , the dpc , vexed with the developments , including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee , has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option . ` ` this would only eventually come into effect . it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved ' ' . apparently , the dpc intends to do some arm - twisting .  at the board of directors meeting in london , which maharashtra was initially disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contentions on the project , the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that the offer of renegotiation had come rather ` ` too late ' ' . it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome . it did not , however , rule out the option of talks , thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon .  the maharashtra chief minister , mr . vilasrao deshmukh , had hoped that dpc would not take any ` ` harsh step ' ' which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay . in fact , the mandate of the team that went , on the strength of its stake in the dpc , was to put across the idea that negotiation was the requirement and not confrontation .  echo in ls  the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister , mr . suresh prabhu , said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs . 2 , 840 crores , whose liability in the project agreement was limited . the centre ' s liability in case of termination is one year ' s electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million .  blow to fis  the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions ( fis ) which , under the leadership of the idbi , were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice . the exposure of indian fis in the project is understood to be not covered by any guarantee either of the centre or the state .  the times of india , friday , 27 april 2001  enron ready to pull out , but lenders say wait  the dabhol power company board , which met on wednesday in london , authorised the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra state electricity board . the company , however , may not pull out of the project yet , considering its lenders , who met on monday , opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations . sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue , domestic financial institutions , led by the industrial development bank of india , prevailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move . enron needs the lenders ' consent to file a pre - termination notice for pulling out from the project . the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move .  another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of the project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms . institutions are yet to disburse about 30 per cent of the sanctioned package , which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project . ` ` the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pre - termination notice . but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious re - negotiation proceedings , ' ' said mseb chairman vinay bansal , who attended the board meeting . ` ` mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs 401 crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings . ` ` we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable , "" bansal added .  ` ` they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction , ' ' said a top banker who was present during the lenders ' meet . ` ` there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance , ' ' he added . the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank , credit suisse first boston , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank of india , where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials . however , some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum 5 per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings .  meanwhile , in a clear reversal of roles , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa . ` ` we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us , including dpc , ' ' deshmukh said . deshmukh was echoing union power minister suresh prabhu ' s sentiments , who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row . he , however , added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments , and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the $ 2 . 9 billion project would be a blow to india ' s efforts to woo foreign investors .  the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore and interest towards the bills due for december 2000 and january 2001 . meanwhile , mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs 134 crore was paid on thursday as protest payment , despite the dispute over the amount .  when asked on the future course of action , bansal said it was up to the dpc .  the hindu businessline , friday , april 27 , 2001  dpc board authorises md to issue ppa termination notice  the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) has authorised the managing director , mr neil mcgregor , to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ( ppa ) with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) ` ` at an appropriate time ' ' . the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday . ` ` while mseb , which is an ` interested party ' , was not allowed to vote , it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter , ' ' a senior state government official said .  the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one . idbi voted against the decision , the official said . the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a six - month ` ` suspension period ' ' . according to clause 17 . 8 of the termination procedure , of the ppa : ` ` following the giving of a preliminary termination notice , the parties shall consult for a period of six months ( or such longer period as they may agree ) as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances . . . ' '  idbi and state bank of india , the principal indian lenders , had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time . at least one lender has to consent for the company to serve termination notice . it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent . however , domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the ppa is abandoned mid - way .  according to institutional sources , indian lenders are trying to get all the parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues . the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation . mr vilasrao deshmukh , chief minister of maharashtra , yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated . mr yashwant sinha , union finance minister , is also understood to be of the same opinion . ` ` the dpc will now have to decide what is the ` appropriate time ' to serve the notice , ' ' the official said . mseb pays rs 134 crore : meanwhile , mseb has paid dpc rs 134 crore towards its march 2001 bill . mseb officials confirmed that the bill was paid ` in protest ' ' today morning . ` ` they ( dpc ) had billed us for an amount of rs 146 crore . we do not agree with some of the items included , ' ' a senior mseb official said .  the pioneer , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron testing maharashtra ' s nerves , t n raghunatha  dabhol power company ( dpc ) has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) , the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them , if the dpc board of directors ' decision to authorise its managing director to serve a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication .  the dpc board , in its meeting in london on wednesday , empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb , a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs 2 , 840 crore on the centre . the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of "" interested party "" .  when contacted , the company ' s mumbai - based spokesperson , mr jimmy mogal , declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc board . "" we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london . we will express our views after a few days , "" he said . however , maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc board ' s decision as "" unfortunate "" . "" we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision "" , mr deshmukh said in mumbai .  official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc board ' s decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay . through its tough posture , the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for re - negotiations with the mseb , the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board . the sources said that the dpc ' s reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of the power contract with the mseb .  "" if anything , the dpc ' s reported decision is to mount additional pressure on the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb . as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control , the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb , the centre and the state government , "" the sources said . not surprisingly , the dpc ' s london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra government ' s decision to set up a high - level committee , comprising representatives of the mseb , the centre and the state government to re - negotiate with the enron ' s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity board . meanwhile , amidst the threat of a possible termination notice hanging on its head , the mseb on thursday made a "" protest payment "" of the rs 134 crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs 146 . 64 crore to dpc .  riday , april 27  the telegraph , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron signal to switch off dabhol power  enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversy - ridden dabhol power company when it won an authorisation from the company ' s board to stop sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .  the meeting of the company , of which the houston - based energy giant holds 65 per cent and the mseb 15 per cent , was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible termination . the centre ' s liability , if enron decides to snap the agreement , will be a year ' s power bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . however , the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls the plug . the centre shrugged off the move , saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out . "" we do not see fdi inflows into the power sector being hit , "" power minister suresh prabhu said . mseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc , which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings . the decision coincided with a rs 134 - crore ' protest payment ' by the cash - strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs 146 . 64 crore .  there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed tempers at enron ' s hub in houston , and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head . mseb officials brushed away the allusions , saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the state - wide bandh . "" we have a disputed payment of rs 12 . 64 crore , which will be taken up at the dispute - resolution forum , "" a board official said . last week , dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments in a move to fortify its legal position .  mseb officials say bechtel and general electric , the other partners who hold around 20 per cent in dpc , are willing to go along with enron corp in terminating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game because it puts their loans at risk . investments made by indian institutions are not covered under the centre ' s and state ' s counter - guarantees , unlike those made by international lenders . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh called enron ' s decision unfortunate . "" we had told state government officials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties . ""  the statesman , friday , april 27 , 2001  enron threatens to pull out  the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director , mr k wade cline , to serve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the $ 2 . 9 billion power project . the decision , which could lead to the cessation of dabhol ' s power supply to the state , was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra state electricity board , mr vinay bansal .  while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything , it is learnt that mseb was itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meeting . mseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congress party president , mr sharad pawar , and union power minister mr suresh prabhu , who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , and an mseb delegation last monday .  the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the centre is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counter - guarantee . further , the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme step . the union power minister , mr suresh prabhu , contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only 0 . 7 per cent of the total energy output of the country , its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation .  however , if terminations proceedings go through , enron corp , a 65 per cent share - holder in the dabhol power company , would stand to net a hefty amount in damages . the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs 1 , 800 crore , which is the total of one years ' electricity bill and a termination fee of $ 300 million . according to an energy analyst , mr pradyumna kaul , the total liability would not cross rs 350 crore . however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs 2 , 840 crore . it is learnt that on 20 april , mr deshmukh had given the go - ahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc ' s board of directors on wednesday . at the meeting , the energy minister , padamsinh patil , energy secretary , mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vinay bansal , were also present . the notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on 24 april . however , the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough , given its huge stake in the project , and that such a notice would not be necessary . the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff , with enron ' s consent .  among those present at the london meeting were mr lal , mr bansal and mseb technical director , mr p paunikar , in their capacity as directors . however , they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party . the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board , it is learnt . the chief minister , mr vilasrao deshmukh , said the state was not in favour of terminating the project . this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to arm - twist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months cleared . the mseb owes enron rs 146 . 64 crore for march 2001 and rs 229 crore for december 2000 and january 2001 . the centre today put up a brave face on enron ' s decision saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power sector in the country , pti reported from new delhi .  "" there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company . as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse impact on fdi in power sector , "" power minister suresh prabhu told reporters when asked about dpc ' s decision to authorise management to issue a termination notice to mseb . emphasising that there would be no fallout of such decision , prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs "" we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well as european nations in the power sector . "" in fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector . ""  mid day  ' dpc may not wind up '  maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgregor , managing director of the dabhol power corporation ( dpc ) , has been given complete powers with regard to dpc ' s operations in the state , including the authority to wind up operations , it does not necessarily mean that mcgregor will issue such a termination notice . mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday . ranganathan said that state officials , including maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal , have reported back to him about the meeting in london .  with regard to the state ' s failure to pay enron , ranganathan said , "" bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and dpc owes some money to us . our people informed enron officials about this . . in fact , there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination notice . "" in the london meeting , mseb and industrial development bank of india ( idbi ) representatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs 411 crore since it could not supply power whenever needed .  chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the decision of the board of the enron - promoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations . deshmukh added , "" we have already requested enron not to take any harsh decision . "" deshmukh had earlier said , "" we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy company from winding up operations in the state , as it would be harmful to both of us . ""  enron officials are keeping mum on the issue . mcgregor said , "" i am not going to give any comment . ""  mid day , april 27 , 2001  enron offers ' no comment ' on renegotiation , h s rao  a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , promoted by the us energy major enron , was held here yesterday apparently to discuss fate of its $ 900 - million power project in maharashtra , but there was no official word on the indian and state governments ' decision to renegotiate the contract .  an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting , saying the issues discussed at the meeting were ' confidential ' . "" we have not received any direct communication . unless we get it and evaluate the details , we have no comments to make , "" the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on re - negotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) has 15 per cent stake .  asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india , the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them . enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the company ' s stake in dpc . maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state government would pay up the undisputed dues to the company . he said the maharashtra government "" is not in favour of terminating the 2184 - mw project , but wanted an amicable solution to the imbroglio . ""  mid day , friday , april 27 , 2001 ,  committee to renegotiate enron deal  a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol power company will be appointed by this evening , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today . addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted social reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha , deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow , at the most . he termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue with power company .  "" renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee . we don ' t want to take any hasty decision , "" deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicably . when pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state  s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee , chief minister said it was unfortunate .  earlier , in his meeting with hazare , deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people . he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months .  afternoon , april 27 , 2001  ' enron ' s on ! '  state govt . to renegotiate dabhol power project , by hubert vaz  the us power giant , enron power corporation ' s willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise , though the dabhol power company chief , mr . wade cline , has been authorised to do so , since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter .  disclosing this , chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning that the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the power project at dabhol could be continued , and at the same time enron did not feel slighted . "" enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision . we are waiting for their letter , "" he said . when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge , mr . deshmukh said , "" let our officers come back . after that we will decide a future course of action . but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project . it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enron ' s decision but as of now the project is still on . "" when asked whether the project could be moved to another state , if wound up from maharashtra , mr . deshmukh said , that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government . however , it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself , he indicated . he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated .  the board of directors of the dabhol power company , which met in london on wednesday , decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the project once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project , if he deemed it fit . however , this decision , as of now , does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project . the enron project , which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception , had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time . the previous sena - bjp government , which had been out to terminate the project , however , chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enron ' s top visiting officials like ms . rebecca mark . and , the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago .  meanwhile , state energy minister dr . padamsinh patil , when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house , said the state government and the central government have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron . "" it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that . they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides , "" he said . in case the project is terminated , the government can still manage the power needs of the state , though it would be a bit tough job , he added .",0,subject enron india newsdesk april 27 th newsclips fyi news articles

' this is clearly a hard problem ( e . g . does this just  mean response - time measurement , can it be done by passive means , how  should the measurements be presented , etc . ) .  in short  - rtfm

"" these are very large operations and to some extent they can bear  some risks , "" says pawel kaminski , energy - sector operations officer at  the world bank in warsaw . "" but eventually they have to generate some  return . ""  enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the u . s . it  entered europe in 1989 , setting up in london as the u . k . ' s energy sector  liberalized . it entered the nordic market in 1996 , and today is the nord  pool ' s largest - volume trader .  enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits  for a power plant , and a further 29 months for construction .  just four years after entering the u . k . , enron finished its  1 , 875 - megawatt teesside plant . teesside ' s capacity and cost , at gbp 795  million ( 1 . 32 billion euros ) , are many times larger than nowa sarzyna ' s .  yet teesside was completed in only two - thirds the time . the company  declines to compare development times in various countries .  "" i wouldn ' t necessarily put poland into the same category as russia , ""  says philip davies , regulatory and government - affairs manager at enron  europe in london . "" but obviously , given poland ' s ( planned economy ) past ,  it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process  and get to the starting point . ""  at nowa sarzyna , it took enron nearly twice the usual time to reach  the starting point , even though mr . astramowicz already knew the site ,  and the polish power industry ' s rules .  the nowa sarzyna plant was mr . astramowicz ' s brainchild , and he  burned out the engine in his first bmw as he traveled between warsaw and  the town to craft the deal . a freelance energy - sector entrepreneur  before joining enron , mr . astramowicz sold his interest in nowa sarzyna  to enron in 1998 .  enron has spent $ 132 million to build nowa sarzyna , a 116 - megawatt ,  gas - fired combined heat - and - power plant . quiet , clean and efficient , the  plant stands in stark contrast to most of poland ' s belching , coal - fired  behemoths . when it starts up this month , it will sell its electricity to  the polish power grid , the country ' s high - voltage network , under a  20 - year power - purchase agreement , or ppa , that enron won in 1997 . steam  output goes to organika , the chemical company next door , and helps heat  the town of nowa sarzyna .  the nowa sarzyna plant is more than 80 % financed by commercial - bank  loans for which the only collateral is the plant ' s concluded contracts .  "" they were betting on their good name , "" says michael davies , a  partner with allen & overy , the warsaw law firm that advised enron  poland ' s lenders . "" they are pushing envelopes all the time . ""  that is especially true in a market with 30 % overcapacity , where an  energy law didn ' t even exist until 1997 .  says peter bisztyga , emerging europe utilities analyst at solomon  smith barney in london : "" because enron signed a ppa , they are ok . . .  ( but ) i ' m really not sure building nowa sarzyna was such a good idea . ""  mr . bisztyga says enron could have generated a faster return by  renovating an existing power plant . but , he acknowledges , nowa sarzyna  "" allowed enron to get into the polish market early and stamp their name  on it . ""  in 1994 , polish power plants weren ' t for sale . energy asset  privatization , discussed for years , began in earnest only this year . by  2002 , the polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of  power plants , 33 distribution companies and the polish power grid , a  12 , 000 - kilometer national transmission network of high - voltage lines .  the assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys ( 8 . 4 billion  euros ) , but murky regulations have driven prices down .  "" the regulations don ' t promote competition and so you don ' t really  know the price of electricity , "" says bengt wegemo , president of  vattenfall poland . earlier this year , vattenfall paid $ 235 million for  55 % in warsaw - based elektrocieplownie warszawskie , promising $ 340  million in investment in the heat - and - power plant over the next 10  years .  investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing .  ultimately , 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will  trade on the bourse , setting the wholesale price of electricity . the  polish bourse will be modeled on its nordic counterpart . enron , the nord  pool ' s largest trader , hopes to post polish trading profits by 2001 .  but first , say market experts , poland ' s 1997 energy law must be  amended to ease functioning of the bourse , and free up access to  poland ' s distribution network .  further , the government says it must solve the competition problem  posed by the polish power grid ' s power - purchase agreements , which  account for 70 % of energy sales in poland . some state - owned plants used  the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing . when  prices are freed , these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete  with plants that didn ' t spend money to modernize .  the government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the  modernized plants for their extra costs . though nowa sarzyna is a  private plant , the price enron must charge for its power is about twice  what outmoded plants charge .  "" we are hoping that continuous , efficient operation of the plant will  generate us a ( bigger ) profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  another problem is cross - border power trading , where contradictory  legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the polish power grid , also  known as pse . enron and others protest that pse shouldn ' t compete with  electricity - market participants who contract with it for transmission  service .  pse intends to stay in the trading business , says marek zerka , pse ' s  vice president . in late march , pse and local company kulczyk holding  signed an agreement with preussenelektra ag of germany to export  electricity and coal to eu countries via germany .  "" this is great news , "" mr . astramowicz says . "" if this joint venture  gets access to pse ' s cross - border transmission capacity . . . i would  expect pse to confirm open access to all market participants . ""  enron and others are pushing hard for that access . "" as soon as the  market becomes open , free and non - discriminatory , we will come out at a  decent profit , "" mr . astramowicz says .  folder name : enron in europe  relevance score on scale of 100 : 78  to review or revise your folder , visit http : / / www . djinteractive . com or  contact dow jones customer service by e - mail at custom . news @ bis . dowjones . com  or by phone at 800 - 369 - 7466 .

"Subject: re : generation earnings model  michelle ,  i agree with you that we need to run at least 500 iterations . but i did not  realize that it took 16 hours to run 100 iterations . helen and i talked  earlier about  using parallel computing technique to split the algorithm into smaller parts  and  run the parts separately on different processors , then aggregate the results .  this procedure makes better use of computer power and saves time . looks like  we have to do it this way now . buying a more powerful computer helps but  does not solve the problem .  in addition , we might want to re - consider if writing the code in vb is  optimal .  i was assured at the very beginning that vb runs as fast ( if not faster ) as c ,  but some re - assurance from it group on this issue is helpful .  best ,  alex  from : michelle d cisneros @ ect 04 / 09 / 2001 02 : 52 pm  to : alex huang / corp / enron @ enron  cc : gary hickerson , danielle romain  subject : generation earnings model  hi alex -  danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations .  we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process ?  thanks ,  michelle  x 35435  hi alex -  danielle and i were talking to david m . today regarding running the model for  purposes of back testing the results . last week we ran calpine using 46 days  of historical forward price data at 10 and 100 iterations . the 100 iteration  run took 16 hours to run . to run all 20 companies with the 46 days worth of  data and at 100 iterations is estimated to take about 28 days . we are  concerned that 100 iterations will not be sufficient and will need to be  increased to at least 500 iterations .  we are thinking that we need to use a server or something much more powerful  than the test computer we have been using . do you have any suggestions as to  how we can improve the process ?  thanks ,  michelle  x 35435",0,subject generation earnings model michelle agree need run least 500 iterations realize took 16 hours run 100 iterations helen talked earlier using parallel computing technique split algorithm smaller parts run parts separately different processors aggregate results procedure makes better use computer power saves time looks like way buying powerful computer helps solve problem addition might want consider writing code vb optimal assured beginning vb runs fast faster c assurance group issue helpful best alex michelle cisneros ect 04 09 2001 02 52 pm alex huang corp enron enron cc gary hickerson danielle romain subject generation earnings model hi alex danielle talking david today regarding running model purposes back testing results last week ran calpine using 46 days historical forward price data 10 100 iterations 100 iteration run took 16 hours run run 20 companies 46 days worth data 100 iterations estimated take 28 days concerned 100 iterations sufficient need increased least 500 iterations thinking need use server something much powerful test computer using suggestions improve process thanks michelle x 35435 hi alex danielle talking david today regarding running model purposes back testing results last week ran calpine using 46 days historical forward price data 10 100 iterations 100 iteration run took 16 hours run run 20 companies 46 days worth data 100 iterations estimated take 28 days concerned 100 iterations sufficient need increased least 500 iterations thinking need use server something much powerful test computer using suggestions improve process thanks michelle x 35435

( in high speed communication bandwidth scenarios , for example ,  the dimensions could be price , bandwidth size , time for which bandwidth  available , continguity of the allocation , and such . )  2 ) it involves dynamic matching as opposed to "" static "" matching .  3 ) it is multi - lateral .  4 ) it adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions .  5 ) it allows traders to make important trade - offs , as they do in  traditional markets .  currently , skg is involved in discussions with the heads of trading at  fidelity , putnam investments , lehman bros . , kpmg , meridien research ,  salomon smith barney , jp morgan , state street , banc of america , mckinsey ,  citizens power , and a host of other folks .  we think we have a value - adding service to provide to enron online or any  other enron subsidiary that the skg offering matches and that you deem fit .  skg ' s founders and i will be very happy to provide you or your  representative ( s ) with more details , including a demo of the prototype , in  a meeting . we are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrange  something appropriate .  thanks very much , jeff ! we look forward to hearing from you .  with warm regards ,  joseph cherian and robert jarrow  cc : professor robert c . merton  joseph a . cherian  associate professor of finance  boston university school of management  595 commonwealth avenue , room 522 h  boston , ma 02215  tel : 617 - 353 - 2679 ( o )  617 - 353 - 6667 ( fax )",0,subject greg fyi jeff asked forward review srs forwarded sherri sera corp enron 05 15 2000 04 25 pm joseph cherian 05 09 2000 08 10 19 jeffrey k skilling cc vince j kaminski robert jarrow robert c merton subject mr jeffrey k skilling president c enron corp dear jeff email robert jarrow cornell joe cherian hope recall meeting lunching bob jarrow keynoted 1999 math finance day conference boston university wanted introduce skg inc startup focused providing innovative service electronic trading community messers kuppuswamy seshadhri sriketan mahanti gaurav mallik principal founders skg inc bob jarrow represent company scientific advisory board nobel laureate robert merton also sat table keynote address kindly serves ad hoc senior advisor skg invaluable resource skg including putting us touch jp morgan coincidentally c jp morgan capital corp ed colloton april 7 meeting told us would introduce us c f enron online knows felt skg would huge value adding opportunities however given ed busy travel schedule believe able yet hence joint decision bob jarrow send email skg solution provide dynamic pricing value maximization electronic trading securities commodities ecns atss alternative trading systems achieves process strategic negotiation using automated agents intelligent software manifestations system viewed ecn rather enhancement extant trading system ecn ats clob nasdaq etc initial system design conducted financial instruments trading e g bonds equities strategy much applicable energy power instruments trading high speed communications bandwidth trading web based commodities trading believe interest enron online skg superior existing solutions following way 1 considers multiple attributes e g price time volatility bandwidth high speed communication bandwidth scenarios example dimensions could price bandwidth size time bandwidth available continguity allocation 2 involves dynamic matching opposed static matching 3 multi lateral 4 adapts dynamically changing market conditions 5 allows traders make important trade offs traditional markets currently skg involved discussions heads trading fidelity putnam investments lehman bros kpmg meridien research salomon smith barney jp morgan state street banc america mckinsey citizens power host folks think value adding service provide enron online enron subsidiary skg offering matches deem fit skg founders happy provide representative details including demo prototype meeting therefore hopeful able arrange something appropriate thanks much jeff look forward hearing warm regards joseph cherian robert jarrow cc professor robert c merton joseph cherian associate professor finance boston university school management 595 commonwealth avenue room 522 h boston 02215 tel 617 353 2679 617 353 6667 fax

( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?  recently ,  we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and  how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the  next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could  have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all  over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became  obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to  bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .  merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the  potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another  source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this  business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the  single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online  gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be  an ideal time to is time to invest .  we decided to  find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with  a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,  publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a  close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .  although  ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at  the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .  the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .  and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the  keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it  gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream  gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online  gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers  these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the  company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in  the investment community and driving up its stock price .  after a successful north american launch ,  gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese  and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business  decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest  source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .  what  does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,  one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced  management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .  to join market movers mailings http : / / ggtsstock . com to find out more .  first source data inc .  4535 west sahara ave # 217  las vegas nevada 89102  disclosure and disclaimer  investment news indepth reports ( hereinafter inir ) , operated by first  source data , inc .

"Subject: auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  shelley ,  my colleague , clayton vernon , who has a background in economics , wrote a  short summary of arguments  against the rofr .  we are working on the second approach to the problem : we try to come up with  a numerical estimate of the  value of this option . the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has  distributional consequences :  he has something of value he never paid for . having a numerical estimate of  the value of this option  could help to argue against it . the value of such an option is case specific ;  so we shall rather  produce a template you can use for valuation case by case .  vince kaminski  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by vince j kaminski / hou / ect on 01 / 20 / 2000  08 : 34 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  clayton vernon @ enron  01 / 20 / 2000 08 : 29 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , zlu / hou / ect @ ect  subject : auctions with an incumbent ' s right of first refusal  vince -  here is an essay on the issue you are discussing :  the adverse economic impact of "" rights of first refusal ""  an option to "" first refuse "" to match a competitor ' s offer is a restraint of  free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace . this economic  conclusion is unambiguous .  if an "" incumbent "" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor , for  an item or service of value , then few competitors will invest the time and  expense necessary to prepare and submit offers , those offers will be lower  than they would have been otherwise , and the contract will often be awarded  to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger .  in a traditional auction , where all bids are sealed and the item up for  auction is awarded to the highest bidder , we can safely predict the item will  be awarded to the bidder who values it the most , at a price reflecting the  full value of the item up for auction . this is the efficient result in a  market economy , because the financing of the high bid reflects resources  freely allocated to the high bidder . if the auction has open bids , we can  again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder , albeit at  a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the  highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the  second - highest valuation .  now , in a modified auction , where an incumbent bidder has the right to match  the highest bid and retain the item for himself , each competing bidder must  justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the  following , and likely , scenario : the incumbent does not spend himself for due  diligence , but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the  top bid from a competitor .  simply put , the incumbent with a "" right of first refusal "" can be safely  predicted to simply match their competitor ' s bid by "" rule of thumb . "" but the  incumbent ' s valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the  valuation of the competitor , by the amount of the due diligence and  administrative expenses . and , the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise  of his competitors , not only in their valuations themselves , a nontrivial  financial exercise , but in any operational details required to be submitted  along with the bid .  furthermore , in an esoteric concept known as the "" winner ' s curse , "" a bidder  realizes that if his bid actually prevails , if the incumbent fails to match  it , he almost certainly overbid .  given this , most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when  an incumbent has the right of first refusal , and those that submit a bid do  not rationally invest the time , expense and expertise necessary ; they may  just "" fire off "" a "" low - ball "" bid . after all , in almost every conceivable  "" state of the world "" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose  money . so , the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a  below - market price , despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest  value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its  most efficient use .",0,subject auctions incumbent right first refusal shelley colleague clayton vernon background economics wrote short summary arguments rofr working second approach problem try come numerical estimate value option fact incumbent shipper option distributional consequences something value never paid numerical estimate value option could help argue value option case specific shall rather produce template use valuation case case vince kaminski forwarded vince j kaminski hou ect 01 20 2000 08 34 clayton vernon enron 01 20 2000 08 29 vince j kaminski hou ect ect cc stinson gibner hou ect ect zlu hou ect ect subject auctions incumbent right first refusal vince essay issue discussing adverse economic impact rights first refusal option first refuse match competitor offer restraint free trade impediment efficiency marketplace economic conclusion unambiguous incumbent right match offer made competitor item service value competitors invest time expense necessary prepare submit offers offers lower would otherwise contract often awarded inefficient incumbent instead efficient challenger traditional auction bids sealed item auction awarded highest bidder safely predict item awarded bidder values price reflecting full value item auction efficient result market economy financing high bid reflects resources freely allocated high bidder auction open bids safely predict item awarded correct bidder albeit slightly lower price donor item since bidder highest valuation simply increment infinitesimal amount second highest valuation modified auction incumbent bidder right match highest bid retain item competing bidder must justify due diligence bid preparation expenses following likely scenario incumbent spend due diligence instead uses savings help finance matching top bid competitor simply put incumbent right first refusal safely predicted simply match competitor bid rule thumb incumbent valuation item auction less valuation competitor amount due diligence administrative expenses incumbent firm expropriates expertise competitors valuations nontrivial financial exercise operational details required submitted along bid furthermore esoteric concept known winner curse bidder realizes bid actually prevails incumbent fails match almost certainly overbid given competitors even bother bid auction incumbent right first refusal submit bid rationally invest time expense expertise necessary may fire low ball bid almost every conceivable state world arising auction competitors expect lose money incumbent almost always retains contract market price despite incumbent necessarily placing highest value contract incumbent put contract efficient use

"Subject: re : energy derivatives  hi vince ,  hope all is well with you . i ' m looking forward to seeing you again next  week and meeting with grant . can you guys do me favour ? i ' m sending out  some sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! )  to my request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of  the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .  finally , we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11 .",0,subject energy derivatives hi vince hope well looking forward seeing next week meeting grant guys favour sending sample chapters people responded positively request feedback book chapter 1 overview book couple sentences chapter could please write sentence two chapter including already written see style many thanks best regards chris 2 overview book book aims provide depth understanding pricing risk management energy derivatives remainder chapter give overview fundamental principals needed model price energy assets underlie rest book well introducing techniques underlie black scholes modelling framework discuss numerical techniques trinomial trees monte carlo simulation derivative pricing used extensively later book chapter 2 analyse spot energy prices apart describing empirical prices propose number processes used model prices look well know process gbm well mean reversion stochastic volatility jump processes discussing showing simulated parameters estimated chapter 3 written vince kaminski grant masson enron capital trade chapter 4 examines forward curves energy markets although curves well understood straight forward world debt markets difficulty storage many energy markets leads less well defined curves chapter chapter 5 presents overview common common derivative structures energy markets discusses uses examples products analysed chapter include variety swaps caps floors collars well energy swaptions compound options asian average rate options barriers lookbacks ladder options chapter 6 investigates single multi factor models energy spot price pricing standard energy derivatives closed form solutions forward prices forward volatilities european option prices derived presented models chapter including three factor stochastic convenience yield interest rate model jumps chapter 7 shows prices path dependent american style options evaluated models chapter 6 simulation schemes developed evaluation european style options applied variety path dependent options order price options incorporate early exercise opportunities trinomial tree scheme developed tree built consistent observed forward curve used price exotic well standard american style options chapter 8 develops new methodology valuing energy options based modelling market observed forward curve approach results multi factor model able capture realistically evolution wide range energy forward curves user defined volatility structures extremely general form closed form solutions developed pricing standard european options efficient monte carlo schemes exotic options chapter finishes discussion valuation american style options chapter 9 focuses risk management energy derivative positions chapter discuss management price risk institutions sell options derivatives client faced problem managing risk time begin delta hedging portfolio containing derivatives look extensions gamma hedging using models chapters 5 7 general model chapter 7 ideally suited multi factor hedging also discussed chapter 10 looks key risk management concept value risk applied portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios discussing concept measure look key inputs volatilities covariances correlations etc estimated compare fours major methodologies computing var delta delta gamma historical simulation monte carlo simulation finally look testing var estimates various underlying energy market variables finally finish credit risk energy markets chapter 11

nationals in the oil industry in  favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum  of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united  state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and  is now ready to be transferred being that the  companies  that actually executed these contracts have been  fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .  consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil  service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign  accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in  return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the  transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for  incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will  be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts  in due course .  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds  within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of  the above stated terms .  our assurance is that your role is risk free . to  accord this transaction the legality it deserves and  for mutual security of the funds the whole approval  procedures will officially and legally processed  with your name or the name of any company you may  nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .  once more i want you to understand that having put  in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my  country , i am averse to having my image and career  dented . this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .  please you should signify your intention to assist  by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this  transaction , if favorable we will take further steps  to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction .  i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100 % risk free as we have done our homework  properly .  i quite believe that you will protect our interest  by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are  still in government service , which we intend to  retire from in full honor .  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to  enable us include this transfer in the next batch  which would constitute the new quarter payments  for the 2002 financial year .  thank you and god bless .  dr james alabi",1,subject immediate reply needed dear sir dr james alabi chairman contract award review committee set federal government nigeria new civilian dispensation award new contracts review existing ones came know search reliable reputable person handle confidential transaction involves transfer huge sum money foreign account series contracts executed consortium multi nationals oil industry favor n n p c original values contracts deliberately invoiced sum us 12 320 000 00 twelve million three hundred twenty thousand united state dollars amount approved ready transferred companies actually executed contracts fully paid projects officially commissioned consequently colleagues willing transfer total amount account subsequent disbursement since civil servants prohibited code conduct bureau civil service law operating opening foreign accounts names needless say trust reposed juncture enormous return agreed offer 20 transferred sum 10 shall set aside incidental expenses internal external parties course transaction mandated remit balance accounts due course modalities worked highest level ministry finance central bank nigeria immediate transfer funds within 7 working days subject satisfaction stated terms assurance role risk free accord transaction legality deserves mutual security funds whole approval procedures officially legally processed name name company may nominate bonefide beneficiary want understand put twenty five years civil service country averse image career dented matter therefore treated utmost secrecy urgency deserves please signify intention assist sending reply email state position transaction favorable take steps brief full details viable transaction want assure business proposal 100 risk free done homework properly quite believe protect interest taking deal strictly confidential still government service intend retire full honor kindly expedite action behind schedule enable us include transfer next batch would constitute new quarter payments 2002 financial year thank god bless dr james alabi

"Subject: status  vasant -  i hope you had a wonderful vacation back home , and are rested and recovered  from the long flight back .  i wanted to give you an update of the eol project , the gas model , and of my  intentions here at enron .  software ( in compiled c on the unix platform ) has been developed and debugged  to listen to the eol trades , process them , book them , and file them away . in  addition , software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on  a continual basis , and to store the entirety of open positions on eol in a  dynamic matrix facilitating analysis . it has yet to get back with me on how  the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit  purposes .  these data files are stored in a format for reading by excel or by sas , for  which i have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines  elucidating the structure of the data .  i am in the process of documenting all of this for you .  with regards the gas model and its slow performance on the compaq , dell has  agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the compaq , to see if  the performance issue of the lp is related to the compaq . i have been  researching this issue with it here and with compaq and dell . the new machine  will be here any day now ( no financial obligation to anyone ) , and i will be  able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is  compaq - specific .  i am also in the process of documenting the gas model for you .  i ' ve tried to do my best for you , vasant , but i have been frustrated by not  only the death of my mother but some internal systems in it here . just the  other day , sas could not open a full query of the eol database because there  wasn ' t enough free space on the server ' s hard drive for the workfiles . in  discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power  trading , people whom i have known for over 10 years , they indicated they were  ubiquitous here . the power traders have similar pc ' s to my new one , and they  have complained from day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones . also ,  there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses ;  during my brief tenure here it has gone through two differing proposals as to  how to address this . when i have been told of tools available for real - time  data harvesting , my requests for such have typically been met with "" well , we  have it , but we haven ' t really tested it yet . "" an example is the weather : we  still do not record to disk the hourly nws observations from the goes  satellite .  my interests here are to help enron to do well , because i will do well only  if enron does well . these aren ' t empty words - my ira is 100 % invested in the  enron stock fund . i believe my best contributions to enron will be in the  areas of systems as well as modeling , and the difficulty working in the  research group , in terms of systems development , is that , frankly , few people  at enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems . we aren ' t  directly generating revenues for enron , and we aren ' t really their customers ,  except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses .  as it happens , power trading posted an opening for a modeling and forecasting  person , and i spoke with them and they asked me to take the job , reporting to  george hopley . it is a wonderful opportunity for me , vasant , as they are  interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their  traders ' access to real - time fundamentals data . i was completely candid with  kevin presto regarding my shortcomings here in research - i told him you were  disgusted with me because i repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines . they  also understand i have yet to be at enron for 1 year , and thus may only bid  on a job with your permission . we agree the move is good for enron ; we all  work for enron , and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but  merely permit it . they are comfortable with me - they have known me for years  as a hard worker , honest and unpretensive . they have already ordered a  state - of - the - art unix workstation and server for me , and they have told me  they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful ,  including hiring an analyst to work for me . and , i have already been able to  teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis i  have learned here .  so , i am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening . it would be  a lateral move in position and salary , and i would commit to you to help you  in any way possible in the future with regards the gas model or the eol  database . i will continue to work on their improvement , and complete their  documentation .  as it happens , i am away on enron business in portland monday and tuesday ,  and will be back wednesday . i had wanted to talk face - to - face instead of by  email , but enron business supercedes - i am on a team designing the data  warehouse for floor trader support .  clayton .",0,subject status vasant hope wonderful vacation back home rested recovered long flight back wanted give update eol project gas model intentions enron software compiled c unix platform developed debugged listen eol trades process book file away addition software developed debugged mark market continual basis store entirety open positions eol dynamic matrix facilitating analysis yet get back software informed trades ultimately rejected credit purposes data files stored format reading excel sas written data step program basic tabulation routines elucidating structure data process documenting regards gas model slow performance compaq dell agreed loan one competing machines compaq see performance issue lp related compaq researching issue compaq dell new machine day financial obligation anyone able immediately ascertain whether problem model compaq specific also process documenting gas model tried best vasant frustrated death mother internal systems day sas could open full query eol database enough free space server hard drive workfiles discussing issues good friends mine power trading people known 10 years indicated ubiquitous power traders similar pc new one complained day 1 slower old ones also remains large frustration development data warehouses brief tenure gone two differing proposals address told tools available real time data harvesting requests typically met well really tested yet example weather still record disk hourly nws observations goes satellite interests help enron well well enron well empty words ira 100 invested enron stock fund believe best contributions enron areas systems well modeling difficulty working research group terms systems development frankly people enron seem care researcher thinks systems directly generating revenues enron really customers except relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses happens power trading posted opening modeling forecasting person spoke asked take job reporting george hopley wonderful opportunity vasant interested large system modelng power grids well improving traders access real time fundamentals data completely candid kevin presto regarding shortcomings research told disgusted repeatedly failed meet time deadlines also understand yet enron 1 year thus may bid job permission agree move good enron work enron acquiescence move endorse merely permit comfortable known years hard worker honest unpretensive already ordered state art unix workstation server told commit whatever resources necessary successful including hiring analyst work already able teach analysts improved techniques data harvesting analysis learned requesting permission bid job opening would lateral move position salary would commit help way possible future regards gas model eol database continue work improvement complete documentation happens away enron business portland monday tuesday back wednesday wanted talk face face instead email enron business supercedes team designing data warehouse floor trader support clayton

"Subject: re : choosing the riskfree rate  dear all ,  i completeley agree with ben that treasuries are the most liquid and reliable  benchmarks . i also think that fmas have their own advantages and  disadvantages .  however , it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using libor  as benchmark - at least to price anything related to capital markets ( for  example , credit default swaps ) . our prices will always be different from  that on capital markets if we use benchmarks different from the market .  as a half - way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example , use  anything , that we decide is closest to risk - free , to value products  significantly different from that priced on capital markets , and libor for  everything priced on capital markets .  we can adjust by manipulating other coefficients ( event , liquidity ,  recovery ) for our purposes , but it looks like benchmark should be libor .  to avoid negative default probabilites ( for highly rated reference entities )  we can add cost fo repo and haircuts ( as all bankers do ) .  let us continue our discussion on this .  slava  benjamin parsons  13 / 03 / 2000 20 : 07  to : bryan seyfried / lon / ect @ ect , martin mcdermott / lon / ect @ ect , viacheslav  danilov / lon / ect @ ect , stuart ffoulkes / lon / ect @ ect , eklavya sareen / lon / ect @ ect ,  tomas valnek / lon / ect @ ect , john metzler / lon / ect @ ect , simon brooks / lon / ect @ ect ,  konstantin malinovski / lon / ect @ ect  cc : vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , steven  leppard / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra patel / lon / ect @ ect , william s  bradford / hou / ect @ ect , harry arora / hou / ect @ ect  subject : choosing the riskfree rate  dear all ,  following on from the discussions had with vince et al a few weeks ago ,  regarding the problems inherent in using treasuries as our benchmark riskfree  curve , i ' ve written the attached short document . my preliminary conclusions  are as follows :  recent turmoil in the treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30 - year bonds .  treasuries are still the most liquid curve , and that used by banks for  benchmarking risky debt .  there is a considerable a liquidity / scarcity premium inherent within the  corporate - treasury spread , which we are not taking into account . more  accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy  prices based on treasuries , which are consistent with the market .  all further comments are welcome of course .  regards  ben",0,subject choosing riskfree rate dear completeley agree ben treasuries liquid reliable benchmarks also think fmas advantages disadvantages however looks like would difficult us avoid using libor benchmark least price anything related capital markets example credit default swaps prices always different capital markets use benchmarks different market half way solution different benchmarks example use anything decide closest risk free value products significantly different priced capital markets libor everything priced capital markets adjust manipulating coefficients event liquidity recovery purposes looks like benchmark libor avoid negative default probabilites highly rated reference entities add cost fo repo haircuts bankers let us continue discussion slava benjamin parsons 13 03 2000 20 07 bryan seyfried lon ect ect martin mcdermott lon ect ect viacheslav danilov lon ect ect stuart ffoulkes lon ect ect eklavya sareen lon ect ect tomas valnek lon ect ect john metzler lon ect ect simon brooks lon ect ect konstantin malinovski lon ect ect cc vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect vince j kaminski hou ect ect steven leppard lon ect ect jitendra patel lon ect ect william bradford hou ect ect harry arora hou ect ect subject choosing riskfree rate dear following discussions vince et al weeks ago regarding problems inherent using treasuries benchmark riskfree curve written attached short document preliminary conclusions follows recent turmoil treasury market mostly hit 10 30 year bonds treasuries still liquid curve used banks benchmarking risky debt considerable liquidity scarcity premium inherent within corporate treasury spread taking account accurate measurement premium allow us calculate bankruptcy prices based treasuries consistent market comments welcome course regards ben

"Subject: p + option valuation model  mark ,  after recently reviewing the booking of the p + options , it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated geometric brownian motion processes ( i . e . the price process assumptions are consistent with standard black - 76 model assumptions extended to two commodities ) .  the payoff for a call option is :  payoff = max ( 0 , a - b - k ) .  where :  a = nxwti ( delivery price for nymex )  b = posting price = ( wti swap ) - ( posting basis )  k = posting bonus ( fixed ) .  the only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "" b "" of the spread is a combination of three prices , the two futures prices which make up the wti swap for the given month , and the average posting basis during the delivery month . combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "" b "" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the nxwti price . i believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative , which would be to use a three or four - commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices .  in summary , i believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options , assuming that the inputs are set correctly .  regards ,  stinson gibner  v . p . research",0,subject p option valuation model mark recently reviewing booking p options understanding options valued using standard spread option model price evolution two legs spread assumed correlated geometric brownian motion processes e price process assumptions consistent standard black 76 model assumptions extended two commodities payoff call option payoff max 0 b k nxwti delivery price nymex b posting price wti swap posting basis k posting bonus fixed complication option compared spread options leg b spread combination three prices two futures prices make wti swap given month average posting basis delivery month combination prices easily addressed simply setting volatility leg b correlation correctly account volatility basket prices correlation nxwti price believe approach straightforward alternative would use three four commodity model associated volatility correlation matrices summary believe appropriate model valuation types options assuming inputs set correctly regards stinson gibner v p research

"Subject: hedge effectiveness test for fair value hedges  gentlemen :  we have had favorable responses regarding the use of our volatility  reduction method ( roger , i ' ve attached a copy of our article in case you  hadn ' t seen it ) . however , there continued to be a quibble about how to  create the set of data points that would be inputs into the testing process .  last week the consulting arm of a "" big five "" accounting firm indicated that  the following method proposed by us would be acceptable . we believe this  method overcomes the statistical problems that arise from using interest  rate differences from overlapping ( "" rolling "" ) quarters .  method :  1 ) calculate daily yield curve changes expressed as ratios , using historical  rates from the most recent , say , two years .

"Subject: preface for book  vince ,  ?  hope you are well .  ?  we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book , and  you kindly offered that you would provide this . ? is this still possible ? ? we  realise that you are extremely busy , so chris and les went ahead and wrote  something , which is below , and if you want to review , change or re - write ? the  preface , that would be very appreciated . ? let me know what your thoughts are .  ?  thanks ,  julie  ( we ' re getting close )  ?  ?  preface  ?  ?  ?  one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives : pricing and risk  management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for  the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible , to discuss  in - depth the models , and to show how they relate to each other . ? in this  way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models , price a wide  range of energy derivatives , or to build a risk management system which uses  a consistent modelling framework . ? we believe that for practitioners this  last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and  presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving  arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using ad - hoc and inconsistent  models for different instruments and markets ( see also others who propose  consistent models ? ) . ? however , it is not our wish to concentrate on one  particular model or models , at the exclusion of the others because we  believe that the choice should rest with the user ( although it will probably  be clear from our discussions the model ( s ) we prefer ) . ? we therefore try and  give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of all  the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models  which best suit their needs .  ?  in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model  and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book . ?  in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing , which are used throughout  the book .  ?  in chapter 2 we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices . ? as well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that  can be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of  geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion , stochastic volatility  and jump processes , discussing each and showing how they can be simulated  and their parameters estimated .  ?  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron corp . , discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets . ?  this chapter builds on the previous one . ? it examines in detail the methods ,  merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different  pricing models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and  electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative  aspects of calculating volatility .  ?  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . ? although such  curves are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial  markets , the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well  defined curves . ? in this chapter we describe forward price bounds for energy  prices and the building of forward curves from market instruments . ? we  outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building  forward curves in energy markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric  approach , and deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic  factors .  ?  chapter 5 presents an overview of structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . ? examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options , and ladder options .  ?  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . ? closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the  models in this chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience  yield and interest rate model .  ?  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . ? simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . ? in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . ? this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard european and  american style options .  ?  chapter 8 describes a methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the whole of the market observed forward curve . ? the approach  results in a multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the  evolution of a wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined  volatility structures can be of an extremely general form . ? closed - form  solutions are developed for pricing standard european options , and efficient  monte carlo schemes are presented for pricing exotic options . ? the chapter  closes with a discussion of the valuation of american style options .  ?  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions . ?  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the  problem of managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a  portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma hedging  )  illustrating the techniques using both spot and forward curve models . ? the  general model presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor  hedging of a portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  ?  chapter 10 examines the key risk management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative products . ? after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . ? we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma ,  historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same  portfolio of energy options . ? in this chapter we also look at testing the  var estimates for various underlying energy market variables .  ?  finally , in chapter 11 we review modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) ) and creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed information is publicly available . ? together these provide an  extensive set of tools with which to measure credit risk . ? we present  numerical examples of applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  ?  before we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book are tools which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of  how both the  + tool  , and the market works . ? the techniques we describe are  certainly not  & magic wands  8 which can be waved at data and risk management  problems to provide instant and perfect solutions . ? to quote from the  riskmetrics technical document  &  ( no amount of sophisticated analytics will  replace experience and professional judgement in managing risk .  8 . ? however ,  the right tools , correctly used make the job a lot easier

"Subject: lng by rail  vince ,  i was thinking about the type of things you could be talking to jeff shankman  about , in the dabhol lng context . it occurred to me that one way to collect  on regas charges , and still find alternate cutomers for gas is through the  railways .  some time back , i had looked into the possiblility of transporting lng by  train . apparently , technology exists wherein lng can be put into cryogenic  containers that can be trucked as well as the same containers being loaded  from trucks to train bogies . i believe this maybe a way to earn some monies  with lng by developing just such a market in india for commercial customers .  it is pertinent to note that the konkan rail line is just about 1 hr . 45  minutes from the dabhol plant . trucks from dabhol could carry lng to the  rail line at guhagar from where it could travel up and down the west coast of  india . if we target end - consumers directly , we could easily sell at retail  type prices , and build in a large margin , even if the volumes disposed are  relatively smaller .

"Subject: 75 % reduction in road accidents  august , 2002  dear sir / madam ,  in case you have received this mail earlier , kindly ignore this mail . it may have  been re - sent to you by mistake . ours is not a mailing list and we have no intention of sending any regular mails to anybody .  we have devised a set of systems , which can reduce the damage caused to vehicles and deaths and injury caused to passengers and pedestrians in vehicular accidents by more than  seventy - five percent  we have already filed and are in process of filing further , multiple and appropriate disclosure documents , provisional patent applications at the united states patent & trademarks office ( uspto ) , and also applications under the patent co - operation treaty at world intellectual property organization ( wipo ) at geneva .  there is absolutely no doubt that our idea is new and innovative . moreover , we are very confident and very sure that this will help reducing / minimizing human suffering to a very large extent . there is no doubt that the product devised by us will change the face of the earth forever . brief details relating to our product are detailed in the annexures under the following headings :  statistics advantages  options  economics  we are looking for the followings :  01 . business consultancy and advice regarding the most viable , practical and profitable course of action under the circumstances and also consultancy on patents one person moderately injured every three seconds ; one person mildly injured every three seconds . )  ( c ) current yearly automobile sales worldwide - more than 1000 billion us $ .  ( d ) number of automobiles worldwide - more than 1000 billion pieces  ( e ) daily loss caused due to vehicular accidents worldwide  more than 2 billion us $ per day .  ( 2 % of the worldwide gross national product of more than 36500 billion us $ = more than 730 us $ per year = more than 2 billion us $ per day )  theadvantages of the technology developed by us :  a . the introduction of such technology will dramatically reduce the expenses of auto - insurance . this reduction of insurance cost will be at par with or even more that the expenses incurred towards the introduction of such technology in modern day vehicles . accordingly , the life insurance premier will also undergo drastic reduction . additionally , because of saving of lives , the outgo of the insurance companies will reduce substantially .  b . as per the who studies and projections , road accidents occupy the number nine positions by way of causes of death in the world today . it is projected by who that by the year 2020 they will occupy the number three positions , next only to heart disease and depression .  by introduction of this technology , we are sure that this will not happen . on the contrary there will be massive reduction in the number of deaths due to road accidents and road accidents may not figure on the list of major causes of death , in the year 2020 at all .  c . this technology will therefore , make all vehicles cheaper and safer . not only will the cost be reduced , safety which is priceless in itself , will also be greatly enhanced .  as and when the regular patent application is filed and patent is granted , the life of the patent will be 20 years . even at the current levels , with road accidents placed at number nine on the who list as a major cause of death , there is a daily loss of two billion us $ . even at the present level , over a period of twenty years , without any interest and without any compounding , this loss works out to be :  2 billion us $ x 365 days x 20 years - 14 , 600 billion us $ .  d . our technology will ensure that at least seventy - five percent of the above losses are prevented . such figure works out to be more that 10 , 000 billion us $ . it is important to note that this is the projection at the current level . as per the future projections , the incidents of road accidents are expected to increase . hence , the figure is likely to be increase very substantially . in addition the time factor and the interest factor will inflate this figure further .  e . at the current levels , more than 1 . 2 million persons are dying every year due to road accidents . even at the current rates , more than 24 million lives will be lost in road accidents over the next twenty years ( i . e . life of the patent , when granted ) . besides , at the current levels .  3 . 2 million people are injured every year . in the next twenty years , the number of people injured due to road accident , will therefore be more than half a billion .  f . if we add to that the personal , physical and psychological traumas to those directly involved in and also to those who are associated with the people involved in the road accidents . the trauma and the misery and henceforth the value of the savings , are all unmeasurable in quantities , presently known to human kind .  g . considering the figures and dynamics as explained hereinabove , it may not be improper or out of place to compare this technology with the introduction of electricity , computer or aircrafts in terms of its value to mankind .  h . the benefits of this technology will be so obvious and essential that , in the very near future , the use of this technology will become unavoidable . it should and will become mandatory by law , to install such technology and the installation of such technology should and will be a pre - requisite for granting or renewal of the registration and license of all vehicles in future .  i . as described hereinabove ; this technology and its utility are incomparable , outthought of , and unheard of till date . it will open a new floodgate in human travel and safety measures . in future , it can and will be applied to other mode of transport , like aircrafts and trains also .  . among other things , we have the following options available to us : - options  available to us : -  a - outright sale  ( a ) immediate outright sale of the idea and the concept along with our filed applications for one time lump sum consideration .  ( b ) further development of the concept and further filing of patent and all patent related applications , before taking steps as outlined in "" a "" .  the process ( b ) will obviously increase the realization in terms of price .  b - licencing options  i ) new vehicles - granting of licenses to manufacturers of automobiles , individually or collectively , all over the world for incorporation in the automobiles to be manufactured in future on fixed time or per piece basis .  ii ) conversion of existing vehicles - to independent agents for conversion of the existing more than 1000 billion vehicles all over the world .  c - combined options  a collaborative arrangement with some private and / or government agency wherein we receive a certain down payment and then jointly distribute the licensing rights on a pre - decided sharing ( partnership ) arrangement .  the economics of the project will be as follows : -  1 ) in case any / all processes and systems described by us are incorporated in the design of new vehicles and the new vehicles are manufactured in accordance with the modified designs , the cost escalation may not be more than 5 % to 8 % , and the safety and the protection will be ten times ( more than ) the price escalation . hence , drop in insurance premier will compensate for the cost escalation .  2 ) in case , the existing vehicles are modified , the cost involved will be approximately 10 % to 15 % of the value of the vehicle .  but partial modifications at a lower cost , which will give partial protection , may also be carried out . as a thumb rule , the cost of modification in percentage terms will be about one fifth of the percentage of safety and protection provided .  3 ) in case the value of the vehicles is low or the life of the vehicle is about to expire , the partial modifications may be practically and economically viable , as incorporation onto a new vehicle is relatively less expensive and more protective .  4 ) there are more than 1000 billion motor vehicles in the world at present . besides there are an unspecified number of non - motorized ehicles .  5 ) almost all of them can be converted in phased manner to a variable degree . the cost of conversion will be directly proportional to their current market value and the safety shield to be generated there from .  6 ) among the motorised vehicles , the conversion cost may work out of few dollars for every percent of safety shield created the exact calculation can be worked out , but over all , some of the methods may provide more safety at lower cost compared to the other which may differ in efficiency .  7 ) even if we consider a very vague and approximate cost of conversion of 300 us $ per vehicle , the conversion industry works out to be worth 3 , 00 , 000 billion us $ .  8 ) realising the potential of the product in terms of human safety , it will be reasonable to presume that majority of such conversion will be completed over a period of three years from the starting date .  9 ) as pointed hereinabove , the size of the conversion industry may be estimated to , in the range of 1 , 00 , 000 billion us $ per year over the next three years .  10 ) alternatively , considering the diversity of available motorised vehicles all over the world , conversion licensing can also be commercially viable proposition . for such conversion , licenses can be granted on - line , on receipt of on - line payments . in that case , different rates for granting conversion to vehicles having specific registration numbers can be granted in accordance with and in proportion to the size , carrying capacity and the engine power of the vehicle .  11 ) in case , licensing is done , the creation and installation of the concerned systems will be done by the end - user , as per his circumstances and needs . however , piracy is likely to be a major problem in such licensing .  12 ) it is likely that as and when the systems are introduced in the motorised vehicles , unusual and unprecedented demand of new vehicles is created . this will result in massive rejection of the vehicles currently playing all over the world and stimulate an entirely new market as far as motorised vehicle is concerned . the size of such market is difficult to either comprehend and / or estimate .  p . s .  1 ) some of the figures have been rounded off but generally the figures are correct .  2 ) we have tried to keep this communication brief and to the point . more details , including website references are available with us and can be provided , if required .

( richardson ' s statement and fpa section 202 ( c ) order is posted on doe ' s  web site at :  http : / / www . energy . gov / hqpress / releaseso 0 / decpr / pro 0309 . html )  2 . ferc ' s 12 / 15 / 00 final order to fix california wholesale markets  ( ferc ' s order can be viewed at  california supplies ordered by richardson  o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso  o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage , but ends 12 / 21 / 00 ,  unless extended  o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso , or ferc will set rate later  o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977  as he said he would on december 13 , u . s . department of energy secretary bill  richardson found "" an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage  of electric energy "" and issued an emergency order under section 202 ( c ) of  the federal power act ( fpa ) requiring listed generators and marketers to  provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the  california iso . in a statement , richardson said the threat to the  reliability of the california grid requires a long - term solution , but that in  the short - term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts .  the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it  has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing  requested service to the iso . the iso must inform each supplier subject to  the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9 : 00 pm ,  eastern standard time , the day before the services are needed . the order  directs the iso to allocate , to the extent feasible , requested services among  subject entities in proportion to each supplier ' s available excess power .  the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3 : 00 am , eastern  time , december 21 , 2000 , unless extended . to continue to obtain supplies  under this emergency authority , the iso must re - certify the shortage to doe  headquarters every 24 hours .  the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers  to the iso "" are to be agreed to by the parties . "" if no agreement is reached ,  then under the fpa ' s emergency authority secretary richardson "" will  immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to  the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date  by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures , and will  prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and  reasonable . "" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under  emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do  not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202 ( c ) . the doe  organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section  from ferc to doe .  the 76 entities identified in the order ' s attachment are all the entities  that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days . those entities  are ordered "" to make arrangements to generate , deliver , interchange , and  transmit electric energy when , as , and in such amounts as may be requested by  the "" iso , "" acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators . ""  [ source : doe secretary richardson ' s december 14 , 2000 statement and order ;  electric power daily , december 15 , 2000 ]  ferc de - federalizes california markets , adopts other structural  reforms  a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion  at its special meeting today , ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited  final order reforming the california wholesale markets , adopting the major  outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the  responsibility for addressing state - related matters , as discussed below . at  the same time , ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as  well as the imposition of region - wide price caps .  ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances ,  california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates  due to california ' s "" seriously flawed "" market structure and rules in  conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west .  while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus - based outcome  that appropriately balanced all competing interests , each commissioner  expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order . chairman  hoecker and comm . breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement , while comms .  hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission  had either "" over - reached "" or not gone far enough , just as they did on  november 1 , as discussed below .  highlights of key actions :  ( 1 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate , effective immediately ,  the state ' s mandatory requirement that the state ' s investor - owned utilities  buy and sell electricity through the px , and allow these utilities to  purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative  mechanisms to manage supply risks . ferc terminated the px ' s rate schedules  effective at the close of business on april 30 , 2001 . in effect , as chairman  hoecker stated , the order de - federalizes 60 percent of the california  wholesale market established under the state ' s restructuring law , returning  ratemaking authority over company - owned generation to the california public  utilities commission ( cpuc ) .  ( 2 ) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $ 150 / mwh "" soft cap ""  proposal , limiting its application through april 2001 , whereupon a  "" comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which  incorporates appropriate thresholds , screen and mitigation measures "" must be  in place . in a related move , ferc ordered a technical conference early next  year to develop such a program by march 1 , 2001 , so that these measures can  be place by the may 1 , deadline .  in a major modification , ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that  while certain refund conditions will continue to apply , unless ferc issues  written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under  review , refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days .  as proposed , however , supply bids in excess of $ 150 will be prohibited from  setting the market - clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above  $ 150 / mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential ,  weekly basis and provide certain cost support .  ( 3 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of  independent , non - stakeholder governing board for the iso . the iso governing  board must relinquish their decision - making power and operating control to  the iso management on january 29 , 2001 . a future order will set procedures  for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process .  ( 4 ) in a major modification , ferc adopted a $ 74 / mwh "" price benchmark "" for  assessing prices of five - year energy supply contracts . this benchmark will  be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of  pricing long - term contracts .  to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable  rates , ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market  participants .  ( 5 ) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to  schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day - ahead market and  instituting a penalty charge for under - scheduling ( in excess of five percent  of hourly load requirements ) , in order to discourage over - reliance on the  real - time spot market .  ( 6 ) ferc directed the iso and the three investor - owned utilities to file  generation interconnection standards .  ( 7 ) ferc affirmed the longer - term measures proposed in the november 1 order ,  including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2 ,  2001 .  ( 8 ) ferc deferred resolving key issues , including establishing new iso board  selection procedures , developing appropriate market monitoring measures and  negotiating protective orders associated with data collection .  ( 9 ) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to  resolve state issues , such as : ( 1 ) immediately implementing the availability  of day ahead markets for power purchases ; ( 2 ) development of demand  responses ; ( 3 ) siting of generation and transmission ; and ( 4 ) assurance of  sufficient reserve requirements .  commissioner responses  comm . hebert reluctantly concurred , calling the final order a "" missed  opportunity "" to , among other things , send appropriate signals for new  generation siting and conservation . reiterating his november 1 concerns ,  hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission  should and should not have adopted . while expressing pleasure at the tone of  the order ( "" balanced and considerate "" ) , the bid certainly reversal , and the  role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board , hebert  nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order , which  he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low . hebert faulted the commission  for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order  approving the ca iso ' s emergency $ 250 / mwh "" soft cap "" proposal . hebert ended  by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to  forward contract , including easing the existing prudence review requirements .  comm . breathitt endorsed the order , reiterating her support for progress  towards open and competitive markets . she noted that the order properly  "" walked the line "" by taking all of the competing interests into account ,  calling it less than ideal , but a step in the right direction . she also  concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will  be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of  the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint . additionally she mentioned that any price below the  $ 74 / mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable .  comm . massey concurred , but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for  california ratepayers , stating that he felt that market power had been  exercised , that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers  had profited too much at the expense of others in the market . he warned  that , as he understood the legal precedents , the federal courts were poised  to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on  to consumers . on the positive side , he approved of the de - federalization of  60 % of the market and the creation of long term contracts . however , he  emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of  creating more generation and transmission . in the long term , comm . massey  hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference  and that the market would have rules more like pjm .  finally , comm . massey articulated what he would have liked to have done  differently . he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not  enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the  on - going investigation . he also disagreed with the $ 150 / mwh breakpoint ,  preferring instead a hard price per generator . the commissioner said he  would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and  that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west . finally ,  he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds .  chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced  to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high . he feels that it is  now time for the state regulators and markets to act . he noted that by  shrinking the cal px , the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the  long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the  least amount of damage to the utilities . in regards to suggestions for a  regional price cap , the chairman stated that this would not work due to the  fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville , wapa and the  public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest .  however , he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to  address regional issues . finally , in conceptually addressing the california  situation , the chairman stated that competition or "" deregulation "" did not  fail in california , but that there never was competition in california .",0,subject alliance info alert richardson ferc

"Subject: re : uk power / gas  vince , just fyi :  oliver ( risk control in london ) was asking if it is appropriate to use a set  of factors corresponding to some commodity for another commodity .  this "" mapping "" we do quite frequently in our var system when forward prices  for a commodity are not correlated ( because of poor price history ) .  i think using this kind of mappings is ok because we can not trust these  correlations based on illiquid price information .  if we believed the matrix with low correlations represents what goes on in  the market and we simply can not reconstruct it with our 7 factors - then  we might use more factors then 7 or the matrix itself .  tanya  tanya tamarchenko  12 / 15 / 2000 02 : 36 pm  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect ,  naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  subject : re : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i completely agree with you : validating var inputs like positions , prices and  volatilities which are used by risktrac is the first thing to do .  you also rise a valid question : if the factor loadings for some commodity do  not make sense should we use the factor loadings for another commodity ?  the factor loadings "" do not make sense "" when the correlations across the term  structure are not high . so if we believe that the forward prices for this  commodity are market prices and statistical analysis on these prices produces  the correlations which we trust , then it would be proper to use this  correlation matrix in var engine , not the factors . using factors is simply  the way to speed up calculations for highly correlated prices without  sacrificing the accuracy .  tanya .  oliver gaylard  12 / 15 / 2000 07 : 11 am  to : naveen andrews / corp / enron @ enron  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : uk power / gas  naveen  regarding the calculation of uk vars in risk trac i agree that we should be  using this calculation engine for all commodity vars . however we should not  focus solely on the uk but ensure that we use risk trac for continental power  and gas , uk power and gas , nordic power .  to use risk trac i think the following need to be resolved first , to  implement it "" right the first time "" , as i think it is incorrect to consider  the risk trac numbers "" as the most accurate "" since it depends on the validity  of these items :  positions ( delta and gamma ) and curve mapping - these need to include all  positions including those outside the main risk systems  positions , curves and mapping should now be no problem given the feeds ,  apart from continental power , have been uat ' d and we have the spreadsheet  feeds up and running .  price and vol curves - as used by the risk systems  as above  inter commodity correlation - prompt month  correlation should be easy to calculate given an accurate and complete data  set ( however the incomplete historic data for europe in risk trac , prior to  the formation of the task force , would mean a full data set needs to be  obtained and used ) . term structure of correlation would be good but i  understand this is difficult to use in the calculation .  factor loadings  i think factor loadings should be calculated , on the same data sets used  for inter commodity correlation , for all commodities . if this analysis does  not appear to work i am not sure that using factor loadings for other markets  is adequate . do we need to consider an alternative approach to calculating  var for these markets ?  to ensure this moves forward i think a list of the mile stones ,  responsibilities and time lines needs to be drawn up otherwise i fear the  process of moving across to risk trac from the spreadsheet var will  experience some slippage .  i will call today to start the process off .  rgds  oliver  naveen andrews @ enron  06 / 12 / 2000 21 : 50  to : oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  cc : david port / market risk / corp / enron @ enron , rudi zipter / hou / ect @ ect , wenyao  jia / hou / ect @ ect , kirstee hewitt / lon / ect @ ect , tanya tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect ,  ganapathy ramesh / hou / ect @ ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  subject : uk power / gas  oliver ,  i had a couple of issues pertaining to uk power / uk gas . first ,  just a few notes as it pertains to risk trac uk - implementation :  ( 1 ) in risktrac , currently all the gas curves are mapped to nbp .  ( 2 ) all the power curves are mapped to r 4 ( cinergy ) .  factor loading analysis lends itself only to nbp and the norewgian curves ( for  reasons of liquidity , etc ) . we have decided that nbp and cinergy are the  best curves available at this time .  the spreadsheet which is utilized in the uk also has curves mapped to a  2 - 3 - year old set of factors derived from us nat gas , which is clearly not  optimal . hence  ( 1 ) we should be using risktrac numbers for var , as it is the "" most  accurate "" , both in terms of ene - wide model usage and in terms of the most  recent updated data . ever since uk power came on board in risktrac 3 weeks  ago , the uk power number has been consistently 7 - 8 mm above the numbers in  your spreadsheet . this difference is to be ecpected , given the different  inputs .

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well -

( b ) how enron is disciplining the internal decision making process with  market . this is in many ways the critical aspect of real options that  most finance people miss - - having options is one thing but exercising them  and realizing their value is another . all of the incomplete contracting ,  asymmetric information , and incentive issues are ignored in real options  valuation models . but they are real in practice . my impression is enron ' s  real success is in putting place an organization that is able to mitigate  these problems by imposing a market disciplining .  ( c ) how enron manages the various books that involve physicals , financials ,  credit etc . this is specially important when many of the real assets have  options features and therefore , include non - linear risk profiles . the  story of gas is pretty well understood but not many of the others markets  enron has been moving into over the last few years .  on the gmii front , i think that some interesting opportunities arise when  you think of the spectrum in a way similar to that of dark fiber . i am  working with several people at lucent on this issue . i think it would be  wonderful to engage in a conversation with enron and lucent folks in the room .  i can do a lunch time talk on any of these issues . perhaps we can discuss  some of these over a conference call . clearly , having vince kaminski in the  room would be very important to me .  as for schedules , the first 3 weeks of april are horrible . april 26 / 27 ,  may 3 / 4 are good for me .  regards  nalin  at 06 : 56 pm 03 / 22 / 2001 , mack , iris wrote :  > hi ,  >  > as we briefly discussed , i spoke with one of my colleagues ( dr .  > martin lin ) about your visiting enron to give a talk and to spend some  > time with us to discuss you work in telecommunications , real options ,  > etc .  >  > martin and i are working on various broadband related problems .  >  > we thought it might be helpful if you let us know a bit more about  > the following :  > * when you want to come ( the research group has weekly  > catered lunch on thursday and brown bag lunches on every other friday ) .  >  > * a description of what you want to talk about with respect  > to telecoms , broadband , etc .  > * who you would like to meet with me -

speak on  april 20 .  i am going to be out of town on april 27 , so that leaves either next  thursday ( april 6 ) or may 4 . would either of those times work for you ? i ' m  not thinking of any

30 , 2000 1 : 24 pm  to : ' jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu '  subject : re : real options course feedback  josh ,  some very thoughtful observations . as you know , i had invited one  finance professor to our class on arundel , but he was out of town . i do  plan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the option  models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded .  i do think it is important to face that issue , which is actually covered at  a theoretical level in our last couple of readings .  the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further  discussion , as you suggest . so far , we ' ve been looking at cases where  volatility is "" given "" . the problem of finding an "" objective "" measure of  volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct  risk adjusted discount rate , which is not surprising since the concepts are  almost two sides of the same plate . one approach , of course , is to do some  modeling using traditional decision analysis tools , including subjective  probabilities , but the finance people who write options articles don ' t like  to think about such ideas .  i ' ll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester  continues . i think it was important to surface some of these points early ,  and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a  naive sort of way .  thanks for the feedback and comments .  jim  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : jclevenger @ optionii . bus . utexas . edu  sent : thursday , march 30 , 2000 8 : 42 am  to : jim . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu  cc : josh - clevenger @ reliantenergy . com  subject : real options course feedback  after overcoming the initial ( i hope ) overload of materials and tools  presented  thus far in the semester , it appears to me that you are achieving the  objective  of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety  of  problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded  financial elements .  as a constructive feedback , you have been forthright with us in marking off  areas of this subject which are still controversial . i also realize that  rightly so , real - world application of this type of analysis without a robust  understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions  that  result in a "" house of cards "" effect . my opinion at this point is that two  issues are of potentially "" make - or - brake "" importance if i am to persuade my  superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of  projects  whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by  financial  instruments . these issues are easy to guess :  1 ) discounting and risk free rates : i do not sense that anyone in the  class  has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time  value  questions in the absence of liquidity . is there someone within the finance  department that can present a firmer position on this question ?  2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would  recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this  subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate  arguments  against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility  measures .  if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that :  * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of  equity  options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche  which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the  weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty  are  good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of  the  value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata ,  but  what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a  vertically integrated company ?  * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is  being  proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , )  there is  some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new  ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less  acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded  before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature ""  industries .  of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around  opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas  sectors  as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in  ongoing  changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally  screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses  volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on  speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and  pemex ?  james s . dyer

"Subject: re : option pricing challenge  zimin ,  to generalize your initial comment , for any process ds = mu ( s , t ) * s * dt +  sigma ( s , t ) * s * dz ,  the delta - hedging argument leads to the black - scholes pde .  this is true for any arbitrary functions mu and sigma , and so includes gbm ,  mean reversion , and others .  there is no problem with this , because in the risk - neutral world , which is  what you enter if you can hedge ,  the drift of the "" actual "" process is irrelevant .  i believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price  for mean reversion process . this can only happen if the asset is not  hedgeable , and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the  option pricing . if you assume that the underlying is a non - traded factor ,  then the pde will have to reflect the market price of risk , and the drift of  the actual process is then reflected in the pde .  vasant  zimin lu  10 / 17 / 2000 05 : 20 pm  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect , vasant  shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , pinnamaneni krishnarao / hou / ect @ ect , alex  huang / corp / enron @ enron , kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron , tanya  tamarchenko / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : option pricing challenge  dear all ,  i have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95 . hope you can give  me a convincing answer .  zimin  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  in deriving bs differential equation , we assume the underlying follows gbm  ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz  where mu is the drift , sigma is the volatility , both can be a function of s .  then we use delta hedging argument , we obtain the bs differential equation  for the option price , regardless  of mu .  with the bs pde and boundary condition , we can derive bs formula . fine . no  problem .  question comes here . suppose the underlying is traded security and follows ,  say , mean - reverting process  ds = beta ( alpha - s ) dt + sigma * s * dz  apparantly , this sde leads to a different probability distribution . however ,  using the delta hedging argument ,  we still get the same bs differential equation , with the same boumdary  condition , we get the same bs formula .  not fair !  from another angle , i can derive the distribution from the bs pde for the  underlying , which is the lognormal distribution .  my thinking is : can i drive the distribution for any sde from the option pde  ? the answer should be yes , but got to be  from a different pde rather than bs pde . then what we do about the  delta - hedging argument ?  thanks .",0,subject option pricing challenge zimin generalize initial comment process ds mu dt sigma dz delta hedging argument leads black scholes pde true arbitrary functions mu sigma includes gbm mean reversion others problem risk neutral world enter hedge drift actual process irrelevant believe concern would like see different option price mean reversion process happen asset hedgeable actual dynamics need factored option pricing assume underlying non traded factor pde reflect market price risk drift actual process reflected pde vasant zimin lu 10 17 2000 05 20 pm vince j kaminski hou ect ect stinson gibner hou ect ect vasant shanbhogue hou ect ect pinnamaneni krishnarao hou ect ect alex huang corp enron enron kevin kindall corp enron enron tanya tamarchenko hou ect ect cc subject option pricing challenge dear fundamental question back mind since 95 hope give convincing answer zimin deriving bs differential equation assume underlying follows gbm ds mu dt sigma dz mu drift sigma volatility function use delta hedging argument obtain bs differential equation option price regardless mu bs pde boundary condition derive bs formula fine problem question comes suppose underlying traded security follows say mean reverting process ds beta alpha dt sigma dz apparantly sde leads different probability distribution however using delta hedging argument still get bs differential equation boumdary condition get bs formula fair another angle derive distribution bs pde underlying lognormal distribution thinking drive distribution sde option pde answer yes got different pde rather bs pde delta hedging argument thanks

"Subject: fw : london work  hi ,  how are you ? london seems to be the same as when i left in august - no sun , cold , serious looking people , expensive , etc . in addition , we have had may day riots , a post office bombing , train strike , etc . not to mention all the excitement in enron credit .  it would be nice to know who i am supposed to be reporting to . i am getting loads of conflicting messages - as illustrated in the forwarded email from vasant . according to you and slava , the strategy paper / duffie report seems to be a higher priority . however , vasant seems to indicate ( in his forwarded email ) that this is not the priority at the moment .  in addition , there seems to be lots of chaos in enron credit - not only in the houston office , but even more so in the london office . this brings to mind a russian proverb i learned from slava when he expressed his views on the current state of enron credit - "" a fish rots from the head . ""  finally , i would like to know exactly what you want me to write in this duffie report : do you want to hear what enron credit would like to hear - that all they need is for us to develop a private firm model for their exisiting "" infrastructure "" ? or do you want to hear what i really see , hear , read , etc . ? if the latter is true , then i may need to write two reports , because what i am learning does not look too good and would probably not make the enron credit personnel too happy .  well , i think i have said enough for now . look forward to your feedback .  thanks ,  iris  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : shanbhogue , vasant  sent : friday , may 04 , 2001 3 : 39 pm  to : mack , iris  cc : dhar , amitava  subject : london work  hi iris ,  amitava must have told you that both he and i are getting swamped with work here . as a result , we expect you to take the lead in scoping the enron credit project and making sure the infrastructure is readied . you should also make sure to understand the econometric / data analysis software side of the project - - this is probably more important than preparing a document for duffie right now . you should definitely sit with ben / george and actually run the software with them to get a feel for how it is to be used . but we also need to be able to try out potential other ways of analyzing data . both amitava and i will help as best as we can , and answer any direct questions , but we will have limited time to review documents , etc . i expect amitava to get heavily involved once data starts coming , but we expect you to have already set up the infrastructure etc for the data .  hope the trip is going well . would you be extending the trip for some more time ?  vasant",0,subject fw london work hi london seems left august sun cold serious looking people expensive etc addition may day riots post office bombing train strike etc mention excitement enron credit would nice know supposed reporting getting loads conflicting messages illustrated forwarded email vasant according slava strategy paper duffie report seems higher priority however vasant seems indicate forwarded email priority moment addition seems lots chaos enron credit houston office even london office brings mind russian proverb learned slava expressed views current state enron credit fish rots head finally would like know exactly want write duffie report want hear enron credit would like hear need us develop private firm model exisiting infrastructure want hear really see hear read etc latter true may need write two reports learning look good would probably make enron credit personnel happy well think said enough look forward feedback thanks iris original message shanbhogue vasant sent friday may 04 2001 3 39 pm mack iris cc dhar amitava subject london work hi iris amitava must told getting swamped work result expect take lead scoping enron credit project making sure infrastructure readied also make sure understand econometric data analysis software side project probably important preparing document duffie right definitely sit ben george actually run software get feel used also need able try potential ways analyzing data amitava help best answer direct questions limited time review documents etc expect amitava get heavily involved data starts coming expect already set infrastructure etc data hope trip going well would extending trip time vasant

( this could  possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -  ( ? ) ) depending on what work needs to be done in the future , i could see him  working both on pricing research and this specific business unit .  i have attached alex ' s resume . i assume he would be manager level , but i ' m  not sure of this .  this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume , but the skills that are  useful to us are :  probability / statistical model development  development of theoretical pricing methodology  excellent computer programming skills  database development and data analysis  he has the best understanding of the nerc reliability data format outside of  mike curley , the nerc data manager .  designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by ace power products  for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt .  excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to  hedging insurance portfolios .  if you want to get into superconductor trading , he can design the standards .  can beat me at atari battlezone ( as well as being able to navigate a real  tank through a minefield ) .  one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with  the organization ( with which you did such a good job for me ) and to give him  confidence that he will be able to do state - of - the - art pricing research in  the most innovative company in the world . he is also interviewing for a job  in morgan stanley ' s equity dept .  we will also arrange a meeting with per in ny , but i would like to be in the  office for that , so we can do that next week .  please call me @ 610 - 996 - 2522 if there are any questions . i may not pick up  but i will reply to voicemail promptly . i ' m up 24 hours this week anyway .  thanks ,  - - dave",0,subject alex tartakovski may know trying schedule interview alex tartakovski houston week copying everyone involved wont able coordinate tomorrow brought new daughter home today wife yelling get office found thursday friday bad days wednesday day week would come tuesday night fly wednesday evening probably easiest arrange flight need hotel transportation airport gave donna phone number help assume hyatt would best home number 215 702 3705 day cellular 267 981 5425 way background plan bring 3 people outside company fill vacants group org chart 3 areas specialization needed execute business plan 1 coordination origination 2 deal pricing underwriting 3 modeling portfolio management alex perfect person 3 deepest knowledge probability anyone know efficient building analysis models big job business portfolio management needs redefined real time due lumpiness insurance contracts lack historical methods evaluating risks development pricing models joint effort group research dept need draw expertise research well realtime activity new deals structured want encourage joint work vasant amitava alex background expertise compatible research past 2 years alex spent lot time developing new electricity spot pricing methodology one area excels would expect would valuable resource research well would like able meet vince possible could possibly done vince philadelphia next week time depending work needs done future could see working pricing research specific business unit attached alex resume assume would manager level sure doesnt necessarily come across resume skills useful us probability statistical model development development theoretical pricing methodology excellent computer programming skills database development data analysis best understanding nerc reliability data format outside mike curley nerc data manager designed wrote code pricing model used ace power products deal pricing porfolio mgmt excellent understanding options pricing methodology application hedging insurance portfolios want get superconductor trading design standards beat atari battlezone well able navigate real tank minefield one objective meeting houston make feel comfortable organization good job give confidence able state art pricing research innovative company world also interviewing job morgan stanley equity dept also arrange meeting per ny would like office next week please call 610 996 2522 questions may pick reply voicemail promptly 24 hours week anyway thanks dave
